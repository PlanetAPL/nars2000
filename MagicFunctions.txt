                TO DO FOR MAGIC FUNCTIONS

* Quad function to convert one or more user-defined functions

      []??? 'name' 'Dfn'
  or
      []??? 'name' ('Dfn1' 'Dfn2' ...)

  where 'name' is a symbol or quad function
  and 'Dfn' is the name of a user-defined function/operator

* Perhaps each function name is preceded with a special character
  to indicate whether or not it is to use hidden or visible
  local names

* Change DFNHDR.Y to accept low numbers (1 to 64*1024-1) as
  special Symbol Table Entries

* Convert args, locals, and references to global names to
  special Symbol Table Entries

* Define Quad-Function for access to previous function (if any)
  This function has meaning only when called from within a
  magic function

* Define properties of a function so it may tell if it's a
  magic function

* Note that replacing STE names with numbers obviates use of
  the execute primitive on those names

*
