  <p>The Internet is a great resource, especially for software
    developers who need expert help in the guise of well-crafted
    code and useful ideas.  This project is no exception having
    borrowed with great thanks from the following sources:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="linkleft" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU
      Scientific Library</a> for the factorial/binomial functions
      as well as matrix inverse/matrix divide functions
      (using Singular Value Decomposition) and the Determinant Operator (<span class="APL">-.�</span>).</li>

    <li>Bob Jenkins' <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c">Hash</a>
      routines were used in the Hash table.</li>

    <li>The <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>
      library of Windows Emulation routines contributed
      an implementation of the Windows Edit Control when I
      couldn't get the one in Windows to do what I wanted.</li>

    <li>David M. Gay's <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.netlib.org/fp/">Numeric input/output conversion</a>
      routines were invaluable for full numeric precision conversion (good to the last ULP!).</li>

    <li>Bob Bernecky's <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.snakeisland.com/apexup.htm">APEX project</a>
      contributed many test cases of APL code through which numerous bugs in NARS were found.</li>

    <li>Nicolas Devillard's <a class="linkleft" href="http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/">iniparser</a>
      code was an invaluable resource after I found that the Win32 API has an undocumented limit on the
      size of a string returned by the GetPrivateProfileString API.</li>

    <li>Jason Papadopoulos' excellent <a class="linkleft" href="http://msieve.sourceforge.net/">msieve</a>
      project provided the necessary code to factor integers of arbitrary precision.</li>

    <li>The MPIR team contributed their <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.mpir.org">Multiple
      Precision Integers and Rationals</a> code.</li>

    <li>The MPFR team contributed their <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.mpfr.org">Multiple
      Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library</a> code.</li>

    <li>The GMP ECM team contributed their <a class="linkleft" href="http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/">Elliptic
      Curve Method for Integer Factorization</a> code.</li>

    <li>Mattias Andrée contributed his implementation of <a class="linkleft" href="https://raw.github.com/maandree/hungarian-algorithm-n3/master/hungarian.c">Kuhn's
      Hungarian Algorithm</a>.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>The Hash Table and Symbol Table code was created using the ideas in
      <a class="linkleft"
      href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/christos/www/courses/826-resources/PAPERS+BOOK/linear-hashing.PDF">
      "Linear hashing: A new tool for file and table addressing"</a>, by Witold Litwin,
      Proc. 6th Conference on Very Large Databases, pp. 212-223, 1980.</li>

    <li>The LALR(n) Parser is based upon <a class="linkleft"
      href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=28371&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM">The Syntax of APL: An
      Old Approach Revisited"</a> by Jean Jacques Giardot &amp;
      Florence Rollin, ACM SIGAPL APL87 Conference Proceedings, pp. 441-449.</li>

    <li>The algorithm for the character grade functions was taken from
      <a class="linkleft" href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=804449&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=portal">
      "Sorting - A New/Old Problem"</a> by Howard J. Smith, Jr.,
      ACM SIGAPL APL79 Conference Proceedings, pp. 123-127.
    </li>

    <li>The algorithm for the roll function was taken from
      <a class="linkleft" href="http://sigapl.org/qqv8n3p42.htm">
      "How the Roll Function Works"</a> by E. E. McDonnell, APL Quote Quad, Vol. 8, Number 3, p. 42.
    </li>

    <li>The algorithm for the deal function was taken from

      "APLGOL, an Experimental Structured Programming Language"</a> by R. A. Kelley,
      IBM Journal of Research and Delvelopment, January 1973, pp. 69-73.

    <li>The algorithm for the Fast Boolean functions was taken from

      "The Caret Functions"</a> by E. E. McDonnell,
      Proceedings of The Sixth International Conference on APL,
      1974, pp. 316-323.</li>

    <li>The idea for <a class="linkleft" href="http://wiki.nars2000.org/index.php/Array_Predicates">Array Predicates</a>
      was taken from Bob Bernecky's <a class="pdfLeft" href="http://www.snakeisland.com/predicat.pdf">APEX project</a>.</li>

    <li>The idea for <a class="linkleft" href="http://wiki.nars2000.org/index.php/Point_Notation">Point Notation</a>

    <li>The idea for <a class="linkleft" href="http://wiki.nars2000.org/index.php/Trains">Trains</a>
      was taken from the designers of <a class="linkleft" href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dictf.htm">J</a>.</li>

    <li>The idea for grouping of rows in width-limited output came from Larry Breed in a private communication sometime in the early 1980s.</li>

    <li>This project benefited greatly by discussions (across several decades) with some
      of the many great APL implementors and designers who went
      before me.  To name but a few:  Ken Iverson, Larry Breed, Gene McDonnell,
      Jim Brown, Bob Bernecky, Jim Ryan, John Scholes, etc.

  <p>Phil Chastney built a special version of his SImPL font,
    adding the infinity symbol as well as making other changes, and
    then graciously allowed it to be bundled with NARS2000.  Note
    that this font is licensed for distribution with NARS2000 only.</p>

      particularly with PC/3270 translations.</li>
    <li>Paul Robinson greatly improved the Wiki with numerous excellent design ideas.</li>
