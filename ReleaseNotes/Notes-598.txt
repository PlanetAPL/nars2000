* Fix Bug:  Define New Terminal To Handle N-wise Reduction With Ambiguous Operator

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define <AmbOpX> to include <AmbOp> and <AmbOpAxis> and
    use that throughtout.
  After <MakePrimXXX>, delete <FreeResult> as there's no
    increment to <RefCnt> in the Make function.
  Define new rule to handle N-wise reduction of an <AmbOp>.
  In terminal <AmbOp:>, remove <AmbOpAxis> as that's now part
    of <AmbOpX>.
  In terminal <AmbOpAxis: AmbOp[ArrExpr]>, don't call
    <MakePrimOp3> as that has already been done in <AmbOp>.
  Define new terminal <AmbOpX:> to include <AmbOp> and
    <AmbOpAxis>.
