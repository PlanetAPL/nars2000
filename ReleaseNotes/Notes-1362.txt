Build #1362 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Prepare For VS2013

Directory trunk:

BISON.RULES:
PROTOTYPE.RULES:
  Change name from "... Rule" to "..._Rule".

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Change name from deprecated <tmschema.h> to <vssym32.h>.

DBGBRK.ASM:
DBGBRK.PRO:
DEFINES.H:
  Remove <DbgBrk> assembly code and use <__debugbreak> built into Windows.

DTOA.C:
  Undefine <strtod> before redefining it (it wasn't defined before VS2013).

ENUMS.H:
EXCEPT.C:
REBAR.C:
  VS2013 picks a nit that wasn't in previous versions in that now a "typedef"
    must have name defined by it.  The solution is remove the keyword "typedef".

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Various minor internal name changes to make more readable.
  Remove </NODEFAULTLIB> as it's not worth the trouble to find where they
    put all the functions we need to have in a few libraries.
  Tell the linker not to load the wrong <libcmt[d].lib> file, or it will.

MAKEFILE.PRO:
  Minor changes.

MAKEFILE.PRO.PARSE:
  Remove reference to <pl_parse.*> which is no longer used thanks to 2by2.

MKD64.BAT:
  Call <w32> after finishing so as to return the subst drives to their 32-bit versions.

NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Change name from "... Rule" to "..._Rule".
  Delete "VCWebServiceProxyGeneratorTool"
  Delete "Detect64BitPortabilityProblems"
  Redundant library references are removed, others are re-ordered.
  "Use of macros in file paths no longer supported" is a minor PITA.
  In a "RelativePath" replace all macros with an explicit path.  This applies to the three instances of $(OutDir)\??_parse.c, and the five instances of $(MS_DIR).  All other macros stay the same.
  A consequence of this change is that the $(OutDir) is sometimes hard-coded as "Debug32" or "Debug64".
  A consequence of this change is that the "msieve" directory can no longer be placed anywhere the environment variable %MS_DIR% says; now it must be directly under %NARSROOT% (and referenced as "..\msieve\")
  Include the GSL headers only in those files that need them, rather than globally.

WCOM.BAT:
  Use a different technique to delete an already subst'ed drive even if it's not already subst'ed.
  Define and use LIB environment variable separately for 32- and 64-bit compiles.
  Define new environment variable _NT_SYMBOL_PATH for where to get MS Windows symbols.
  Remove GSL include path from the global INCLUDE as it causes trouble.
