Build #349 -- Version 0.0.1.7
-----------------------------

Directory trunk:

CS_PARSE.Y:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  Include additional rule to handle LEAVE/CONTINUE outside of an IF stmt.

CS_PROC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  Define separate function to handle ENDWHILE stmt (previously we ignored it).
  Expand comment.

DATATYPE.H:
  Define largest allowable Unicdoe code point for []UCS DOMAIN ERROR testing.
  Define bit to mark Selective Specification intermediate array of indices.

DISPLAY.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.

GETFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Clear ptr type bits inside <GetNextValueGlb> so we don't need to do it outside.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.
  Change the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueGlb> to include the ptr type bits so
    we don't need to set them outside.
  Fix typo in comment.
  In <GetNextValueMem> and <GetNextItemMem>, delete the <bExpandSym> and <bGetItem>
    arguments to <GetNextValueMemSub> as they are no longer used.
  In <GetNextValueMemSub>, explain the result if both <lphGlbres> and <lpimmTypeRes>
    are non-NULL.
  In <GetNextValueMemSub>, replace <bExpandSym> with <lpimmTypeRes NE NULL>.
  In <GetNextValueMemSub>, delete reference to <bGetItem> as we always return
    <*lphGlbRes> with the ptr type bits set.

GOTO.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  Avoid referencing a token beyond the number of tokens in the token stream.

PF_COMMA.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of ravel as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.
  Fix Bug:  Remove test for fractional axis from calculation of right and left
    dimensions at and beyond the axis value.

PF_CSLOPE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of transpose as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.

PF_CSTILE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of reverse and rotate as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.
  Clear ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem> as needed.

PF_EPSILON.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of enlist as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.
  Avoid setting ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem>
    as they are already set.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydEpsilonOther>, the result of <PrimFnDydEqualUnderbar_EM_YY>
    is used as if it were a Boolean, whereas it actually is a <lpYYRes>.  Instead,
    save the result, extract the Boolean from it, and free it.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Avoid setting ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem>
    as they are already set.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.
  Improve comments.

PF_IOTA.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.
  Avoid setting ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem>
    as they are already set.

PF_SLASH.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of replicate as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.

PF_SLOPE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Mark result of expand as Selective Specification index array if the right
    arg is one, too.

PF_SQUAD.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.
  Clear ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem> as needed.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, provide spurious <immTypeSub> argument so as
    to force <GetNextValueMem> to return <hGlbSub> as an HGLOBAL only.
  Avoid setting ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem>
    as they are already set.

PL_PARSE.PROTO:
  Include prototype for new function in <pl_parse.y>.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Fix errors in comments.
  Fix Bug:  Define rule for ENDWHILE stmt which was previously ignored.
  Fix Bug:  Never test for <lpplLocalVars->bYYERROR> at the top of
    rule because this might take an erroneous action in the case of a
    double error.
  In <pl_yylex>, return separate token for ENDWHILE.
  In <CheckSelSpec>, mark the index array as special.
  Define new routine to test for Selective Specification index array
    before assigning to the named var.

PO_SLOPE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.

QF_DR.C:
  Update copyright year.

QF_ES.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.

QF_FX.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.
  Clear ptr type bits in the HGLOBAL result of <GetNextValueMem> as needed.

QF_TF.C:
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.

  Update copyright year.
  Test for DOMAIN ERROR against maximum Unicode code point value.
  Fix Bug:  In <SysFnMonUCS_EM_YY> for an APA argument, fix the test
    for out of range values on a per-value basis instead of the
    whole right argument.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Allow immediate chars to be surrounding by either single or double quotes.
  Fix Bug:  Skip over trailing blank after an immediate char.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar> for HETERO arrays, append the simple
    scalar array header before each simple scalar.
  Fix Bug:  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar> for NESTED arrays, surround character
    scalars with quote marks and format as {\uXXXXXX} if non-ASCII.

STARTADDR.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Include more addresses for debugging purposes.

STRAND.C:
  Change comment to reflect new meaning of argument.

SYMTAB.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <SymbolNameToChar>, handle {\uXXXXXX} on input.
