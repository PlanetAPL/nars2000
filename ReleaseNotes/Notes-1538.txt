Build #1538 -- Version 0.4.15.xx
--------------------------------

* Allow -1 As File Offset In []NREPLACE []NREAD To Mean Current Offset

Directory trunk:

QF_NFNS.C:
  Remove test for parenthesized list as it can't occur due to the syntax analyzer.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <SysFnCreateTie_EM_YY>, in the call to <CreateFileW> ensure the normal attribute flag is set.
  In []NREPLACE and []NREAD allow a file offset of -1 to mean the current offset.
