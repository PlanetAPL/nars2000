Build #633 -- Version 0.0.2.9
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Unexpected Messages From COMCTL32.DLL Version < 6.0

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  In <GetModuleFileNames>, get the COMCTL32.DLL file version for
    later testing.

EXTERNS.H:
  Save the COMCTL32.DLL file version # in a global for later testing.

MAIN.C:
  Fix Bug:  When NARS2000 is used with a COMCTL32.DLL whose version #
    is less than 6.0 (typically on a Wine distribution), an unexpected
    WM_NOTIFY (NM_TOOLTIPSCREATED) is sent from the Tab Ctrl tooltip
    which doesn't occur with version 6.0.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Note the dependency of <main.rc> on the appropriate manifest file.

REBAR.C:
  Tell each of the Toolbars about the common Tooltip Ctrl.
  In order to support COMCTL32.DLL version 5.81 on Wine platforms
    we need to specify more extended styles and such for Toolbars
    so as to display Tooltips on Toolbars.
  When initializing each Band, use a two pixel margin top and
    bottom on all buttons so as to display the bottom shadow on
    the buttons.
  In <FW_RBWndProc> and <LW_RBWndProc>, fill in a <cbSize> for
    TOOLINFOW structs which is appropriate to the actual version
    of COMCTL32.DLL.
  Improve comments.
  In <LW_RBWndProc>/<WM_MOUSEMOVE> don't send the <TTM_GETTITLE>
    message to COMCTL32.DLL if the dll doesn't support it.  Instead
    fill in appropriate default values in the return struct.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.2.9.
