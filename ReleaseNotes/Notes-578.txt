Build #578 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Memory Leak With UDFO Identity Element In Inner Product

Directory trunk:

PO_DOT.C:
  Factor out common code to execute a function between the
    prototypes of two arguments.
  Improve comments.
  Fix Bug:  when saving the identity element from a UDFO
    into the result, don't increment the RefCnt of the first
    item as its RefCnt starts at 1.
  Fix Bug:  In the normal case of inner product, if one of
    the comparison steps fails, the test for whether or not
    to free the reduction result is backwards.
