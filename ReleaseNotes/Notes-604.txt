Build #604 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug When Returning A Multiple Name Result From A UDFO

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <MakeMonPrototype_EM_PTB>, use direct reference to item instead
    of through function.
  In <MakeMonPrototype_EM_PTB>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before
    saving in result.
  Fix Bug:  In <CopySymGlbDir_PTB>, when given a named STE, convert
    it to a value-specific unnamed STE.  That way, the named STE
    may be changed without affecting the return value.
  Change <CopyImmSymEntry_EM> to use a named equate instead of -1.
  In <CopyArray_EM>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before saving in
    result.

STRAND.C:
  Change <CopyImmSymEntry_EM> to use a named equate instead of -1.
  In <MakeVarStrand_EM_YY>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before
    saving in result.

SYMTAB.C:
  In <MakeSymEntry_EM>, allow NULL ptr to function token.
  In <CopyImmSymEntry_EM>, use named equate instead of -1.
  In <CopyImmSymEntry_EM>, allow NULL ptr to function token.

SYMTAB.H:
  Define named equate to use instead of -1.
