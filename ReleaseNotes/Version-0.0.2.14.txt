Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In the terminal <RhtOpVal>, the parenthesized var must be marked

    as that seems more appropriate.


Build #693 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Empty Right Arg And Non-Zero Left Arg To Partitioned Enclose

Directory trunk:

PF_LSHOE.C:
  In <PrimFnDydLeftShoeGlb_EM>, if the left arg is a non-zero
    simple scalar, and the right arg is empty along the specified
    (or implied) axis, the result should be empty as the left arg
    is extended to be an empty vector.

------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle File | Save As... Correctly

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Define new message to display the prompt.

MAIN.C:
  Fix Bug:  When selecting File | Save As... from the main
    menu, do not require that the workspace name already exist.
  Fix Bug:  Handle Save As in the SWITCH stmt which follows the
    call to <GetOpenFileName>.

    common code to display the prompt.
  Move code to display the prompt from IDM_SAVE_WS to MYWM_PROMPT.
  Fix Bug:  In <OFNHookProc>, save the message ID during <WM_INITDIALOG>
    and wait until <WM_NOTIFY/CDN_INITDONE> to set the Open button text.

  In <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB>, when copying a named var in a function
    strand, the token type (TKT_VARNAMED) and the data ptr
    (HGLOBAL) are mismatched.  Instead split cases based upon
    the token type and copy the LPSYMENTRY for TKT_VARNAMED.


Build #688 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Display Of Char Var In Function Strand Incorrect

------------------------------

* Delete Code To Handle Variables As Left Operands

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:

    monadic or dyadic operator as it needs to be stranded and as
    such is handled in <DrvXFunc> terminals.

SESSMAN.C:
  Insert DEBUG code to check ptrs when at top most SI level.


Build #686 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Display Axis Operator When Used With A UDFO

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Improve comments.

STARTADDR.H:

    corresponding global memory handle so we can distinguish an
    axis array from a variable array.


Build #685 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Allow A Var In Parens As A Left Or Right Operand To An Operator

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Generalize the left and right operand values as variables from strands
    to variables surrounded by parens.
  In <LookbehindOp>, return FALSE for ambiguous operators so as to allow
    1 2 3/4 5 6.
  In <pl_yylex> upon encountering a right paren surrounding a variable,
    check for a monadic or dyadic operator as the previous token as well
    as for a dyadic operator as the next token after the closing left
    paren.

Directory trunk:

GETFNS.C:
  Optimize <GetGlbHandle> as we're using it more often.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Allow named vars in function strands so as to allow the name type
    to change.

STARTADDR.H:
  Rename <YYCopyGlbFcn> to <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB> as its arg is sensitive
    to the Ptr Type Bits.

YYFNS.C:
  As we're now allowing named vars in function strands, we need to
    call <GetGlbHandle> on the token ptr instead of the <tkGlbData>.
  Rename <YYCopyGlbFcn> to <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB> as its arg is sensitive
    to the Ptr Type Bits.
  In <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB>, don't copy the <YYCopyArray> bit as that makes
    sense at the top level only.


Build #682 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Avoid Duplicate Counting When Copying A Function Array

Directory trunk:

STRAND.C:
  In <YYCopyFcn>, remove TopLvl flag as it's no longer needed.

YYFNS.C:
  Split <YYCountFcnStr> into two parts <YYCountFcnStr/YYCountFcnGlb>
    so as to avoid duplicate counting by diving into global memory
    handles without looking at the outer token count as it isn't
    relevant.
  In <YYCopyFcn>, remove TopLvl flag as it's no longer needed.
  Split <YYCopyFcn> into two parts <YYCopyFcn/YYCopyGlbFcn>
    so as to avoid duplicate counting by diving into global memory

    source ptr past its trailing zero so the memory may be serially
    reusable.

SC_SAVE.C:
  In <CmdSave_EM>, increment <uGlbCnt> after use so as to allow
    for multiple functions in one line (function strand).
  In <SavedWsFormGlbFcn>, pass a ptr to the function name for

    dyadic operator is a Jot, lookahead for the next token to see if
    it's also a dyadic operator so as to catch the {jot} in
    +op2{jot}23 as FILLJOT.

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define a new terminal <ArrValu> to check for <ArrExpr> as a
    VALUE ERROR which can come from a UDFO which doesn't return

SC_SAVE.C:
  Use "sss" consistently as the SI level count in comments.
  Use [TempGlobals] section in saved workspace file to hold
    those entries which get deleted after the workspace is
    saved.  This means we no longer need the SymLink chain
    and all of its supporting code.
  Improve comments.
  When formatting an immediate value, use a SWITCH stmt so as
    to catch missing cases.

  Fix Bug:  In <ChangeRefCntDir_PTB> when changing the RefCnt of
    a permanent var, be sure to clear the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag
    so it doesn't get copied to a copy of the var.

------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Rank Operator Fails To Process The Prototype In The Result

Directory trunk:

PO_DIJOT.C:
