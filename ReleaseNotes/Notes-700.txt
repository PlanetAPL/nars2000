* Fix Bug:  Domino Doesn't Handle Empty Arguments

Directory trunk:

PF_DOMINO.C:
  Both monadic and dyadic domino call <gsl_linalg_SV_decomp> which
    doesn't handle empty arrays well (another good reason to use APL),
    so we check for that case up front and handle it ourselves.
  Remove duplicate GSL free code by simple reorganization.
