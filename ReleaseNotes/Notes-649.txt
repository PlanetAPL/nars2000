PF_LSHOE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In Partitioned Enclose, the case of 2 1 1 2 1 ... was
    missed because when the second 2 was parsed the previous value
    was still 2, so it didn't trigger a new item in the result.
  In <PrimFnDydLeftShoeGlb_EM>, factor out common code and omit
    incorrect DEBUG-only assertion.
