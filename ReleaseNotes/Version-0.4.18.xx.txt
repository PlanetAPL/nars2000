Version 0.4.18.xx consists of the following Builds:


Build #1607 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Changes And Bug Fixes

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Fix DEBUG bug by handling certain cases of <MyGlobalLockTxt>.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Pass <lpSymGlb[Lft|Rht]> to subfunctions instead of NULL as we need it in the case of Global Numerics.
  In certain cases when the result is NESTED, but the calculation is numeric, we make the mistake of saving a
    pseudo result on top of the actual result.
  In <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM> when the result is NESTED, but the calculation is Global Numeric, we save the Global Numeric result
    in the Nested array causing a crash.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <TypeDemote>, we increment <lpMemRht> but fail to restore it to the beginning and re-use that ptr as if it were at the start.


Build #1606 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Handle Syntax: (A A A) F IDX SPA
* Handle Syntax:  A[A] F MOP A
* Handle Syntax:  A[A] F MOP SPA

Directory trunk:

PARSELINE.C:
  Define reduction for "LNR ISPA" as the same as "LNR SPA".
  Define reduction for "NDX SPA" as the same as "IDX SPA".
  Define reduction for "F ISPA" as the same as "F SPA".
  Define macro to extract SynObj of the right stack +3.
  When checking for the "IDX" -> "NDX" translation, be sure to include the
    trailing SPA so we know it's a NAM assignment.
  Rename ADX to NDX to better suggest that this is a Name Index.
  Restore <GetLftSynObj> as we need the special treatment in it.
  Comment out (#if FALSE/#endif) <GetLftToken> as we no longer need it.
  Omit <lpYYRht0> and <lptkRht0> as it always points to an empty entry.
  Handle more syntax cases of modified assignment.

PARSELINE.H:
  Make the binding strength of 'F ISPA' the same as 'F SPA'.
  Lower the binding strength of 'IDX SPA' to xIDX-1 so that 'IDX IDX SPA' -> IDX SPA.
  Lower the binding strength of 'NAM IDX' to xIDX-2 so that 'NAM IDX IDX SPA' -> 'NAM IDX SPA'
  Make the binding strength of 'LNR ISPA' the same as 'LNR SPA'.
  Lower the binding strength of 'ADX SPA' to xIDX-1 so that 'NAM ADX SPA' -> NAM ISPA.
  Define reduction for 'F ISPA' to ISPA.
  Define reduction for 'LNR ISPA' to A.

STARTADDR.H:
  Put <GetLstSynObj> back in and comment out <GetLftToken> as the need for that change
    was solved in <pl_yyLexCOM> with better detection of Name Assignment.

SYNOBJ.H:
  Rename ADX to NDX to better suggest that this is a Name Index.


Build #1605 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F            SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F            SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F[A]         SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F[A]         SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F    MOP     SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F    MOP     SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F[A] MOP     SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F[A] MOP     SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F    MOP[A]  SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F    MOP[A]  SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM    F[A] MOP[A]  SPA
* Handle Syntax:  NAM[A] F[A] MOP[A]  SPA
* Handle Syntax:  (A F) MOP A
* Handle Syntax:  F{is}A
* Handle Syntax:  GOTO SYSLBL

Directory trunk:

PARSELINE.C:
  Define tools needed to handle some of the above syntax cases.
  Change <GetLstSynObj> to <GetLftToken> so as to test the TknType for a named var.
  In <plRedMF_A>, pick out left argument evern if it's on the curried function which handles (A F) MOP A.
  After <PARSELINE_START>, use the appropriate <MyGlobalLock>.
  After <PARSELINE_SCAN1>, pick off cases where we convert an IDX to an ADX which handles the rest of the above syntax cases.
  After <PARSELINE_DONE>, do not set the bSink flag if there's a curried function as that's a SYNTAX ERROR which handles F{is}A.
  In <pl_yylexCOM/case TKT_VARNAMED/case NAMETYPE_VAR>, handle the case of GOTO SYSLBL by not confusing it with a System Function.
  In <pl_yylexCOM/case TKT_VARNAMED/case NAMETYPE_VAR>, handle the above cases with SPA by marking NAM as a vars being assigned to.

PARSELINE.H:
  Lower the binding strength of F SPA so as be lower than that of DOP F so that DOP F SPA binds DOP F before F SPA.

STARTADDR.H:
  Change <GetLstSynObj> to <GetLftToken> so as to test the TknType for a named var.

SYNOBJ.H:
  Comment change.


Build #1604 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* When Executing An Immediate Execution Mode Thread, Initialize The Per Thread Vars

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  In <WaitForImmExecStmt>, free the MPFR cache at the end of the immediate mode execution.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, initialize per thread vars such as the MPFR default precision and rounding mode.


Build #1603 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Handle Indexed Assignment Of Nested Character Constant Into A Simple Var
* Signal INDEX ERROR For A[B;empty] If B Is Not A Valid Index
* Fix Bug Of Wrong Error Message For A[1 2 'a';]

Directory trunk:

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetNextValueGlb>, allow an empty argument.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Fix bug in <ArrayIndexRef_EM_YY>, mis-casting <lpMemHdrSub> as a List Array rather than a Var Array.
  In <ArrayIndexRef_EM_YY>, merge cases.
  In <ArrayIndexRef_EM_YY>, at various points include Assertions so as to catch bugs.
  In <ArrayIndexRefNamImmed_EM_YY>, change the type and name of <lpMemHdrLst> from a List Array to a Var Array header.
  In <ArrayIndexSetSingLst_EM>, for RATs and VFPs, set the new value into the name rather than copy if as the name is already initialized.  This avoids a memory leak.

PF_SQUAD.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, count the number of elements in the result from non-zero indices so as to test for INDEX ERRORs on empty results.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, if the left arg is not numeric, signal a DOMAIN ERROR.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, if the left arg item is a global, but not a global numeric, get the item NELM for later use in case it's empty.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, if the left arg item is a global, but not a global numeric, merge RAT and VFP cases when converting to an integer.
  In <PrimFnDydSquadGlb_EM_YY>, keep track of the item's NELM in case it's empty so as to avoid testing the value for an INDEX ERROR.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <IncrOdometer>, do not increment empty coordinate.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <PrimIdentFnScalar_EM_YY>, do not assume that the identity element is zero.
  In <PrimFnDydSiScSiSc_EM>, after calling <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>, handle the case where the result is a global numeric.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  Change the name with "RhtHdr" to "HdrRht" to conform to naming conventions.
  In <TPA_NEST2NEST>, copy the global handle instead of saving it as the new use is a separate copy and shouldn't be freed when the old handle is.
    This handles the case of an indexed assignment of a nested character constant into a simple var.

YYFNS.C:
  Improve comments.


Build #1602 -- Version 0.4.18.xx

  Implement temporary APVs to handle elided indices.
