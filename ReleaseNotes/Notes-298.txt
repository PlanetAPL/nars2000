YYFNS.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.

CRASH.C:
  Forgot to add it before.

DISPDBG.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Rename/type <lpGlbName> as <lpwGlbName> to reflect its type (LPWCHAR).

DISPLAY.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Fix bug:  When displaying an immediate float via 2 []TF, I used the
    wrong minus sign (BAR vs. OVERBAR), so negative values or values
    in exponential format with a negative exponent are displayed with
    the wrong minus sign.
  When displaying a function via 2 []TF, pass down a pointer to a
    FILETIME timestamp the value for which is obtained from the
    function.  Thus, when called from )OUT, the function timestamp
    may be written out to the .atf file.

EXCEPT.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Use indirection and/or <UlongToPtr> to allow cast to work in
    _win64 environment.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define default values for <bClosingLamp>, range limited []vars,
    and empty assignments to []vars.
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.

INIFILE.C:
  Define equates for [RangeLimits] and [SetEmptyCWS] sections.
  Define equate for <ClosingLamp> keyname.
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Read in/write out <ClosingLamp> value and [RangeLimits] and
    [SetEmptyCWS] sections.

MAKEFILE.W64:
  Uncomment line which checks for 64-bit problems.

PF_RHO.C:
  Use (__int3264) instead of (UINT) to handle 32- vs. 64-bits.
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Remove commented out code.
  Improve comments.

QF_TF.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Pass NULL ptr to <DisplayTransferFcn2> as we don't need the
    function's creation time.
  Use (__int3264) instead of (UINT) to handle 32- vs. 64-bits.

SC_COMMON.C:
  Open file for workspace backup in binary mode to copy the old ws.
  Use cast to allow to work in _win64 environment.
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.

SC_ERASE.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Rename/type <lpGlbName> as <lpwGlbName> to reflect its type (LPWCHAR).

SC_IN.C:
  Move equates about transfer files to their own header file.
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Use (__int3264) instead of (UINT) to handle 32- vs. 64-bits.

SC_OUT.C:
  Implement )OUT.

SORT.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Replace == with EQ and != with NE.

SYMTAB.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Rename/type <lpGlbName> as <lpwGlbName> to reflect its type (LPWCHAR).

TOKENIZE.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Make <fnComDone> sensitive to <OptionFlags.bClosingLamp>.

TRANSFER.H:
  Collect equates for transfer files.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Use UBOOL/LPUBOOL (unsigned BOOL) instead of BOOL/LPBOOL
    to avoid bugs when shifting.
  Fix bug:  The translation from NARS charset to the APL2 charset
    was brain dead.

VER.C:
  Replace == with EQ and != with NE.
