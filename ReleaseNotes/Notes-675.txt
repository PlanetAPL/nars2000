------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Workspace Internal Convention :CONSTANT In Tokenize

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
PL_PARSE.Y:
  Handle the workspace internal convention of :CONSTANT (which represents
    a global memory object) in Tokenize instead of the parser so as to
    allow it to be used in function strands.
