  More work on Customize Dialog.

DEFINES.H:
  Move #defines into common file so it may be
    included in other files without side effects.

    []IC index names and values for use in <CustomizeDlgProc>.
  Define <wszFileVer> to hold the file version string.

  Move <OPTIONFLAGS> struc and definition to be adjacent to

  Change <SAMEFONTAS> to <FONTENUM> for use in <CustomizeDlgProc>.
  Convert title in <CUSTOMIZE> typedef to Unicode.

  Read and save file version string once.

  Many changes for <CustomizeDlgProc>.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Remove unnecessary (LPAPLDIM) to left of <VarArrayBaseToDim>.

  Move error message calls to common labels.
  Use (__int3264) instead of (UINT) to handle 32- vs. 64-bits.
  Factor out duplicate <lpYYRes> and rename to <lpYYRes2> so as
    to avoid confusion.
  Fix bug:  In <PrimFnDydNestNest_EM> when the result is a mixture
    of nested arrays and simple scalars, I forgot to check for the
    scalars.  Instead, I save the scalar value into the result rather
    than a pointer to a SYMENTRY.
