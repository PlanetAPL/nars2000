Release #265, Version #0.0.0.17516
----------------------------------

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  Include "sysvars.h" as we need some if its #defines.
  Handle WM_SIZE in <LclEditCtrlWndProc> and, if requested to do so,
    adjust []PW when the Session Manager width changes.

EXTERNS.H:
  Change default font to SImPL as it has more APL characters.
  Define Boolean variable to determine whether or not to adjust
    []PW when the Session Manager width changes.

PF_DOMINO.C:
  Use GSL routine to solve the SVD equation rather than custom code
    because it handles infinity better.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
