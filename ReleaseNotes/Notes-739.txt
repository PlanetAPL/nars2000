Build #739 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Tab Closing In Proper Order So We Free Everything

Directory trunk:

EXCEPT.C:
  In <DisplayException>, check for invalid ptr, not just NULL.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc/WM_CREATE> and <SMWndProc/WM_DESTROY> upon failure to
    load a workspace, free the SymTab globals.

TABCTRL.C:
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc>, break out the code to free SymTab globals
    into a separate routine so it may be called from multiple places
    and sooner than where it was before the SymTab itself is freed.
