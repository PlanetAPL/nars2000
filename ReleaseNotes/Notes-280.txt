Build #280 -- Version 0.0.0.18228
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

INIFILE.C:
  Remove include statement as we no longer use that method.
  Use <GetEnvironmentVariableW> to get APPDATA= instead of
    looking at the entire environment block.

MAKEFILE:
  Move GSL include files to be under "gsl\" directory.
  Remove references to Cygwin as we no longer need that.
  Define SDK= to point to where SDK files reside (no longer need be
    in "$(MSVC)include\" dir).
  Move MSVC= and following definitions up in the file to make them
    more easily seen.
  Define statements to compile <makepro>.
  Remove <userenv.lib> as we no longer use that method.
  Define OC= for common intermediate files.
  Factor out MAKEVER: and MAKEPRO: targets so they can be called separately.
  Call <makepro> to generate prototypes as we need to launder the output
    for some compilers.
  Use $(OC) instead of $(O) for <makever> and <makepro>.

Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX_BODY.AHTML:
  Note that NARS2000 works on Vista.
  Fix svn:// URL to include repo directory.

MAKEPRO.C:
  Define new file to generate protypes and fix bugs in the resulting
    files as necessary.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Fix bug in monadic format on an empty matrix or higher rank array
    (the compiler found this one).

PF_INDEX.C:
  Fix bug in <ArrayIndexRefLstSimpGlb_EM_YY> where a variable was used
    before it was initialized (the compiler found this one, too).
