Build #657 -- Version 0.0.2.13
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Comparison Of Version Numbers In Update Check Is Wrong

Directory trunk:

MAIN.C:
  Instead of comparing the version #s as strings (which fails for
    x.x.x.8 vs. x.x.x.12), split out the separate numbers, then
    combine them each into a single number and compare those two
    numbers.
