Build #443 -- Version 0.0.1.15
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

PERTAB.H:
  Include <STRAND_LST> and <STRAND_NAM> in the list of arrays to
    <VirtualAlloc> for each session.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <ParseLine>, delete code to <VirtualAlloc> several arrays each
    time it's called as that's now done once by the SM.  Instead,
    initialize the strand Start/Base/Next from the values in PTD
    or the previous <plLocalVars>.

SESSMAN.C:
  Include <STRAND_LST> and <STRAND_NAM> in the list of arrays to
    <VirtualAlloc> for each session.
