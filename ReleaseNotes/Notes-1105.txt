PF_IOTAUND.C:
  Define new magic function for Dyadic Iota Underbar.

PO_MULTISET.C:
  Handle Dyadic Iota Underbar as multiset operand.

  Dyadic Iota Underbar is now sensitive to both []IO and []CT, so it needs
    to be handled differently.

    operator shortcuts when called monadically.

  Document Dyadic Iota Underbar in the Language Bar.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Document Dyadic Iota Underbar as new primitive function.
