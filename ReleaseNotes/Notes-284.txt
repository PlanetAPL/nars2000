Build #284 -- Version 0.0.0.18357
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DFNHDR.Y:
DISPDBG.C:
DISPLAY.C:
PARSE.Y:
  Remove <lpszTemp>, <lpszDebug> & <lpwszDebug> as global vars.


EDITFCN.C:
ERRMSG.C:
EXECDFN.C:
  Move <lpwszTemp> into PerTabData context.
  Remove <lpszTemp>, <lpszDebug> & <lpwszDebug> as global vars.

EXTERNS.H:
  Remove DEF_CTEMP_xxx defines as they are no longer used.
  Rename DEF_WTEMP_xxx defines to DEF_WPTDTEMP_xxx and DEF_WGLBTEMP_xxx.
  Reorder includes to avoid referencing a struct before it's defined (problem for MinGW).
  Remove <lpszTemp> as it's no longer used, replaced by judicious use of <szTemp>s.
  Rename <lpwszTemp> to <lpwszGlbTemp> to catch all uses.
  Remove <lpszDebug> and <lpwszDebug>, replaced by judicious use of <wszTemp>s.
  Remove <lpNameTypeStr>, replaced by <lpwNameTypeStr>.
  Remove MEMVIRT_xxx enums as they are no longer used.
  Rename <MEMVIRT_WSZTEMP> to <MEMVIRT_WSZGLBTEMP> to catch all uses.

INIFILE.C:
TABCTRL.C:
  Rename <lpwszTemp> to <lpwszGlbTemp> to catch all uses.

MAIN.C:
  Rename <lpwszTemp> to <lpwszGlbTemp> to catch all uses.
  Remove <lpszTemp> as it's no longer used, replaced by judicious use of <szTemp>s.
  Remove <lpszDebug> and <lpwszDebug>, replaced by judicious use of <wszTemp>s.

PERTAB.H:
  Fix typos.
  Define <lpwszTemp> and matching <uTempMaxSize> for use in PerTabData contexts.

PRIMFNS.H:
  Replace <struct tagTOKEN *> with <LPTOKEN> as the reordering of #includes in
    <externs.h> no longer requires use of such references, and MinGW is happier.

PRIMSPEC.H:
  Define incomplete definition of <tagPRIMSPEC> as it's referenced before it's defined.
  Rename <tagPrimSpec> to <tagPRIMSPEC> to conform to all other struct tag names.

QF_CR.C:
QF_NL.C:
SC_FNOV.C:
SC_LIB.C:
SC_SAVE.C:
SC_SI.C:
STRAND.C:
  Move <lpwszTemp> into PerTabData context.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Use maximum size for buffer from <LW_Params> rather than from <memVirtStr>.

SAVEFCN>H:
  Define struct member to hold maximum size of buffer.
  Move <lpwszTemp> into PerTabData context.
  Pass ptr to temporary buffer and its maximum size down through various functions
    to where it's needed.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Move <lpwszTemp> into PerTabData context.
  Pass ptr to temporary buffer and its maximum size down through various functions
    to where it's needed.

SC_WSID.C:
  Because []WSID always has a terminating zero, we no longer need to copy it
    to temporary storage.

SESSMAN.C:
  Define new enum for <PTDMEVIRT_WSZFORMAT> (previously a global <lpwszTemp>).
  Allocate virtual storage for the PerTabData <lpwszTemp>.

SYMTAB.C:
  Remove <lpszTemp>, <lpszDebug> & <lpwszDebug> as global vars.
  Define <hashlittleConv> as a wrapper around <hashlittle>, converting any
    _alphabet_ WCHARs to lowercase alphabet WCHARs.
  Define <ToLowerUnd> macro to handle comparisond of _alphabet_ and alphabet WCHARs.
  Compare the WCHARs in the two names modulo _alphabet_ and alphabet differences.

SYSVARS.C:
  Move <lpwszTemp> into PerTabData context.
  Ensure []WSID always has a terminating zero.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Remove <lpszTemp>, <lpszDebug> & <lpwszDebug> as global vars.
  Allow underbar alphabet in var names, but treat as equivalent to lowercase alphabet.

WORKSPACE.H:
  Define struc member for maximum size of buffer.


DIRECTORY trunk\download:

DOWNLOAD-BODY.PHP:
  Move assignments of <$Notes> and <$CurRel> to inside IF/ELSE as they are not valid
    for Special Files, and in fact, generate an entry in PHPERR.LOG because of the
    call to <file_get_contents>.
