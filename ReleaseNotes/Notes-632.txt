Build #632 -- Version 0.0.2.8
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Avoid Crash When The ParseLine Local Var Is Undefined

Directory trunk:

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Fix Bug:  Not all calls to <PrimFnMonUpTackJotPLParse> are done
    in a context in which <lpplLocalVars> is active, so we test
    for that case and don't crash if it is undefined.
