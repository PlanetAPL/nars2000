Build #1364 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In =/'aaa' And In =\'a'

Directory trunk:

MF_ROS.H:
  In <MFON_RoS2>, remove "1/" so that the scan of a scalar returns a scalar.

PO_SLASH.C:
  In <PrimOpMonSlashCommon_EM_YY>, the case =/'aaa' was missed.

PO_SLOPE.C:
  In <PrimOpMonSlopeCommon_EM_YY>, the case of an immediate right arg was missed.
