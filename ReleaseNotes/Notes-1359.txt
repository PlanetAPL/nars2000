-------------------------------

* Rename <signum> Functions
* Fix Bug In LCM Result Sign

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  Define <signumXXX> functions for various datatypes making sure to handle negative 0 as negative.
  Replace <signumf> with <signumflt> to parallel the other <signumXXX> fucntions.

CONVERT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Replace <signumf> with <signumflt> to parallel the other <signumXXX> fucntions.

MACROS.H:
  Define <signumrat> as an alias of <mpq_sgn> as it already returns -1, 0, 1.

MPFNS.C:
PF_DELTASTILE.C:
PF_DSTILE.C:
PF_IOTA.C:
PF_PI.C:
PF_STAR.C:
PF_TIMES.C:
QF_NFNS.C:
  Use <signumXXX> functions in place of previous ones as they are more aptly named and we control them.

MPIFNS.C:
  Move <signumint> and <signumflt> to <common.c>.

PF_UCARET.C:
  Use <signumXXX> functions in place of previous ones as they are more aptly named and we control them.
  Fix bug in LCM so as to return the sign of the result as the product of the signs of the args.

  Include new functions.
