Build #428 -- Version 0.0.1.15
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.H:
  Define COLTYPE enum so we can tell when a column being displayed
    is all character.
  Define separate count of fractional digits which is propagated up.
  Use up two bits in the ColStr to save info on the col type.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  In each FormatArrXXX routine, set the column type (COLTYPE_xxx).
  In <PropagateRowColCount>, propagate the # fractional digits if
    there's only one column so we can use the overall fractional digit
    count to align decimal points.
  In <PropagateRowColCount>, propagate the column type up one level so
    we can tell if a column is all character (and thus left-justify it).
  Improve comments.
  In <FormatArrSimple>, align decimal points and exponent separators
  In <FormatArrNestedCon>, align the decimal points.
  In <FormatArrNestedGlb>, don't right-justify the item if the column
    is all character.
