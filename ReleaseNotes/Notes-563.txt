Directory trunk:

YYFNS.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <YYCopy>, transfer more data from one struc to another when
    in DEBUG mode.
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, include more assertions for function arrays.
  Fix Bug:  In <YYCopyFcn> when making a direct copy, transfer the
    <YYCoptArray> flag.
  Fix Bug:  In <YYCopyFcn> when copying a var or axis array, don't
    increment the refCnt as that was done when the array was created.
  In <IncrFcnMem>, increment a ptr rather than index it so as to make
    debugging easier.
  Fix Bug:  In <IncrFcnMem> for function arrays items which are
    themselves var or fcn arrays, recurse only when the item is
    not a UDFO so as not to double increment the RefCnt.
  Fix Bug:  In <IncrFcnMem> for a UDFO, increment the RefCnt.
