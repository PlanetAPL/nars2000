Version 0.0.2.1 consists of the following Builds:


Build #494-- Version 0.0.2.1
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  File | Save from the main menu still crashes the system;
    sadly, not in the DEBUG version.

Directory trunk:

SC_SAVE.C:
  Fix Bug:  Check for empty command line before zapping it.
    I thought that this bug was fixed by disabling String Pooling
    and, indeed, it is in the DEBUG version (yuck!), but there must
    be something more to it.
