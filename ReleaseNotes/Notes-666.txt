------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When Copying Variable In A Function Strand, Increment
  The RefCnt If Not Called At The Top Level

Directory trunk:

STRAND.C:
  Pass additional arg to <YYCopyFcn> to tell whether or not it's called
    from the top level.

YYFNS.C:
  Pass additional arg to <YYCopyFcn> to tell whether or not it's called
    from the top level.
  In <YYCopyFcn> when copying a var in a function strand, if we're
    called at the top level don't increment the RefCnt, otherwise do.
