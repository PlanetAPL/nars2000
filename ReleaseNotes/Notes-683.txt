Build #683 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Allow Named Vars In Function Strands

Directory trunk:

GETFNS.C:
  Optimize <GetGlbHandle> as we're using it more often.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Allow named vars in function strands so as to allow the name type
    to change.

STARTADDR.H:
  Rename <YYCopyGlbFcn> to <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB> as its arg is sensitive
    to the Ptr Type Bits.

YYFNS.C:
  As we're now allowing named vars in function strands, we need to
    call <GetGlbHandle> on the token ptr instead of the <tkGlbData>.
  Rename <YYCopyGlbFcn> to <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB> as its arg is sensitive
    to the Ptr Type Bits.
  In <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB>, don't copy the <YYCopyArray> bit as that makes
    sense at the top level only.
