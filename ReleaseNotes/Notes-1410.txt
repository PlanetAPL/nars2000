Build #1410 -- Version 0.4.11.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix More Bugs In []STOP And []TRACE

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, handle {goto} w/o target as not suspending on []STOP.
  In calls to <TraceExit> note that the ptr to the result may be NoValue.

QF_STRACE.C:
  In both <TraceLine> and <TraceExit>, exit from TEMP_OPEN checks before calling
    <DisplayTraceResult> as we can't pass the TEMP_OPEN state across into that fcn.
  Move common code from <TraceLine> and <TraceExit> to <DisplayTraceResult>.
  In <TraceExit>, handle immediate results.
  In <DisplayTraceResult>, handle ptr to result of NoValue.
