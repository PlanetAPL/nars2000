Build #357 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename and redefine <gSyntaxColors> from typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORS>
    to typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORNAME> named <gSyntaxColorName>, item
    <syntClr>.
  Append "Web Colors" menu item to the basic and custom colors.
  Improve comments.
  In conjunction with the move of Syntax Color names from <LTEXT>
    entries in <main.rc> to a struc in <externs.h>, we now need
    to write out the static text within <WM_INITDIALOG> for the
    Syntax Coloring property page.
  Remove all references to <ccHookProc> as a means of displaying
    Web Color Names.
  When displaying the menu of colors, expand the test for special
    items to include "Web Colors".
  In response to <WM_COMMAND>, delete references to the three long
    list of case stmts of Syntax Color categories in place of code
    in the default entry for the SWITCH stmt which tests <idCtl>
    against the first and last IDs of the three categories.
  In response to the result from <TrackPopupMenu>, include the
    case of Web Colors.

DEFINES.H:
  Remove references to Web Color class name of "WCClass" and associated
    messages as we're using a Dialog instead of a window.

EDITFCN.C:
  Rename and redefine <gSyntaxColors> from typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORS>
    to typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORNAME> named <gSyntaxColorName>, item
    <syntClr>.

EXTERNS.H:
  Move Syntax Color names from <LTEXT> entries in <main.rc>
    to a struc in <externs.h> so we can use them elsewhere.
  Define struct to contain both the Syntax Color and its name.
  Improve comments.

INIFILE.C:
  Rename and redefine <gSyntaxColors> from typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORS>
    to typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORNAME> named <gSyntaxColorName>, item
    <syntClr>.

MAIN.C:
  Remove references to Web Color class name of "WCClass" and associated
    messages as we're using a Dialog instead of a window.
  Rename and redefine <gSyntaxColors> from typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORS>
    to typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORNAME> named <gSyntaxColorName>, item
    <syntClr>.

MAIN.RC:
  Update copyright year.
  Move Syntax Color names from <LTEXT> entries in <main.rc> to
    a struc in <externs.h>.
  Label each Syntax Color name <LTEXT> entry so we can write to it.
  Define new Web Colors dialog to allow the user to choose on of
    those colors.

RESOURCE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define various IDs for Web Color Names dialog and its controls.
  Renumber entries to make room for expansion -- numbers are cheap.

    to typedef of <SYNTAXCOLORNAME> named <gSyntaxColorName>, item
    <syntClr>.
