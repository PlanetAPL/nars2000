* Fix Bug When Parsing 1 []TF 'a b'

Directory trunk:

QF_TF.C:
  In <SysFnDydTF1_EM_YY> when parsing 1 []TF 'a b', a SWITCH stmt
    falls through to a defstop instead of branching to the empty
    case because the blank after the 'a' is interpreted as marking
    the inverse translation case and the following char is not one
    of 'FCN'.
