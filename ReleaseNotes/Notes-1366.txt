-------------------------------

* Move Compilers To VS2013

Directory trunk:

DBGBRK.ASM:
  Split this file in two, one for 32-bit code and one for 64-bit code.
  Delete this file.

DBGBRK32.ASM:
DBGBRK64.ASM:
  New files one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit code.

MAIN.C:
  Replace deprecated version information APIs with new ones.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Make .asm files sensitive to 32- or 64-bit.

MAKEFILE.W32:
MAKEFILE.W64:
  Remove L98 in favor of LIB as used in <makefile.inc>.
  Rename path for Resource Compiler as it changed in VS2013.
  Remove 32- and 64-bit specific flags as they are no longer needed.

MASM64.RULES:
  Change the path to the 64-bit assembler as it is different under VS2013.

NARS2000.SLN:
  New file merged from <NARS2000.32.sln> and <NARS2000.64.sln>

NARS2000.VCPROJ:
  New file merged from <NARS2000.32.vcproj> and <NARS2000.64.vcproj>

WCOM.BAT:
  Move local customizations from here to <<wcustomize.bat>.
  Remove dependency on drive letters in favor of environment vars.
  Use separate 32- and 64-bit PATH environment var.
  Change LIB environment var to reflect new paths for VS2013 libraries.
  Start VS2013 using new GUI name (WDExpress vs. VCExpress).
  Start VS2013 using merged solution file <NARS2000.sln>.

WCUSTOMIZE.BAT:
  Move local customizations here.

With these changes, this project no longer compiles under VS2008.  It now
requires VS2013 and the Windows 8.1 SDK.

Also, it no longer is dependent upon drive letters to map the 32- vs. 64-bit
compiler and SDK paths.
