* Fix Bug:  Named Var In Function Strand Mishandled

Directory trunk:

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB>, when copying a named var in a function
    strand, the token type (TKT_VARNAMED) and the data ptr
    (HGLOBAL) are mismatched.  Instead split cases based upon
    the token type and copy the LPSYMENTRY for TKT_VARNAMED.
