Build #1572--Version0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug Of Passing Too Large A Limit To UpDown Control For []PP

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Change DEF_MAX_QUADPPxxx names so as to better reflect on their usage as well as make them more readable.
  Use UDM_SETPOS32 instead of UDM_SETPOS and UDM_SETRANGE32 instead of UDM_SETRANGE to be consistent.
  Use special value of DEF_MAX_QUADPP_UDM for UDM_SETRANGE32 for []PP to workaround a bug in the UpDown Control.
