------------------------------

* Pass LPPL_YYSTYPE Instead of LPTOKEN To FreeResult

Directory trunk:

CS_PROC.C:
  Change argument to <FreeResult> and friends so as to gain access
    to more elements of the argument.
  Define <FreeResTkn> to use when there's no YYSTYPE.
  Fix Bug:  In <CS_SELECT_Stmt_EM>, free the <CASE/CASELIST> result
    after using it so as to avoid a memory leak.

EXECFNS.C:
PF_CSLOPE.C:
PF_INDEX.C:
PF_RSHOE.C:
PL_PARSE.Y:
PO_DIERESIS.C:
PO_DIJOT.C:
PO_DOT.C:
PO_JOT.C:
PO_JOTDOT.C:
PO_SLASH.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
SC_IN.C:
  Change argument to <FreeResult> and friends so as to gain access
    to more elements of the argument.
  Define <FreeResTkn> to use when there's no YYSTYPE.

FREE.C:
  If the arg being freed has the YYCopyArray flag set, clear it.
  Change argument to <FreeResult> and friends so as to gain access
    to more elements of the argument.
  Define <FreeResTkn> to use when there's no YYSTYPE.

EXECDFN.C:
  Change argument to <FreeResult> and friends so as to gain access
    to more elements of the argument.
  Define <FreeResTkn> to use when there's no YYSTYPE.
  Fix Bug:  In <InitFcnSTEs> when passing a function strand, handle
    more cases such as vars and immediates.

STRAND.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY> at the end, free YYCopyArray'ed
    items in the arg recursively.
  In <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY>, save back the result into te arg so it may
    be freed.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCopyFcn>, delete the test for <UUCopyArray> as that's now
    done in <YYFreeArray>.
  Change argument to <FreeResult> and friends so as to gain access
    to more elements of the argument.
