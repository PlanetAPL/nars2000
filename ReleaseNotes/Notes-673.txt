* Fix Bug:  Catch The {jot} In +op2{jot}23 As FILLJOT

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <pl_yylex> for dyadic ops (TKT_OP2IMMED or TKT_OP2NAMED), if the
    dyadic operator is a Jot, lookahead for the next token to see if
    it's also a dyadic operator so as to catch the {jot} in
    +op2{jot}23 as FILLJOT.
