Directory trunk\htdocs:

CONTRIBUTORS.AHTML:
  Include link to browse code in the top menu.

INDEX.AHTML:
  Include link to browse code in the top menu.
  Omit )LOAD in TBD list.

Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Insert missing (but unused) closing brace.

Directory trunk:

APLERRORS.H:
  Define error message for when there are too many tabs.

COMMON.C:
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.

DEBUG.C:
  Unlock/Lock around call to <CreateMDIWindowW> to help track down bug (not found as yet).
  Call <LCLODSAPI> around call to <DefMDIChildProcW> to provide more debugging info.
  Remove calls to unhooking <LclListboxWndProc> as we don't need to do that.

EDITFCN.C:
  When writing error message into the SM of an inactive tab, test for inactive tab
    in <WM_PAINT> and ignore the msg (it'll get painted when the window is next visible).

EXCEPT.C:
  Include stack trace code to help track down bug (not found as yet).

EXTERNS.H:
  Reduce address space allocations so we can fit more tabs.
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.
  Widen various strings to simplify code elsewhere.
  Move <gOverTab> to be with other similar vars.
  Move <lpszVersion> to VER.C as it's used there only.

MAIN.C:
  Move local PTD vars up to common stack space in <MFWndProc>.
  Widen various strings to simplify code elsewhere.
  Can't call <CmdSave_EM> from <MFWndProc> as the MF thread is not tab-specific
    and so the code it calls won't work.  Instead, define and use new message.
  Remove calls to unhooking <LclListboxWndProc> as we don't need to do that.

MAIN.H:
  Can't call <CmdSave_EM> from <MFWndProc> as the MF thread is not tab-specific
    and so the code it calls won't work.  Instead, define and use new message.

PERTAB.H:
  Remove <lpwszCurLine> and <lpwszTmpline> in favor of a single global <hGlbCurLine>
    (uses less address space which I'm trying to conserve to as to get more tabs).

PF_COMMA.C:
  If catenating a Boolean value and a Boolean APA (e.g., 32{rho}0),
    make the result Boolean, too.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Use common routine to get <hWndEC> for the Session Manager.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Define routine to check for Boolean APA.

QF_SYSVER.C:
  Improve comments.
  Widen various strings to simplify code elsewhere.
  Re-allocate <hGlbRes> downwards after calculating the actual NELM.

RESDEBUG.C:
  Omit line # from all calls to <_DeleObj> as it is not used.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Fix bug in <SF_UndoBufferLW>, by checking for empty Undo Buffer.

SC_DROP.C:
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.

SC_LIB.C:
  Use command line tail as directory of workspaces to list.
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.
  In <CmdLoadCom_EM>, check for WS NOT FOUND so we don't have to
    write back into the previous tab.
  Switch from separate [Globalxxxs] to one [Globals] so we can
    better handle non-empty SI (though that isn't handled as yet).

SC_SAVE.C:
  In <MakeWorkspaceNameCanonical>, prepend <wszWorkDir> only if the
    input string has no drive letter, and not current or root dir.
  Switch from separate [Globalxxxs] to one [Globals] so we can
    better handle non-empty SI (though that isn't handled as yet).
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.
  Rename <SaveNewWsid> to <SaveNewWsid_EM> to mark that it returns
    an error message.
  Use <ReplaceLastLineCRPmt> instead of <AppendLine> in case called
    as inactive tab.

SC_WSID.C:
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.
  Use <ReplaceLastLineCRPmt> instead of <AppendLine> in case called
    as inactive tab.

SESSMAN.C:
  Remove <lpwszCurLine> and <lpwszTmpline> in favor of a single global <hGlbCurLine>
    (uses less address space which I'm trying to conserve to as to get more tabs).
  Define common function to return <hWndEC> for the Session Manager.
  Define common function to replace the last line and end with a CR/LF.
  Define common function to replace the last line, end with a CR/LF, and display a prompt.
  Define common function to get the line length of a given line in the Edit Control.
  Can't call <CmdSave_EM> from <MFWndProc> as the MF thread is not tab-specific
    and so the code it calls won't work.  Instead, define and use new message.

STARTADDR.H:
  Append more addresses.

SYMTAB.H:
  Reduce address space allocations so we can fit more tabs.

SYSCMDS.C:
  Use <ReplaceLastLineCRPmt> instead of <AppendLine> in case called
    as inactive tab.

SYSVARS.C:
  Change <szSaveDir>/<szLoadDir> to <wszWorkDir>.

TABCTRL.C:
  Set <gCurTab> early in tab creation so we can use it later on.
  Remove calls to unhooking <LclListboxWndProc> as we don't need to do that.
  Gray out unimplemented menu entries.
  In <TCM_DELETEITEM>, call the original window proc so it can delete the tab,
    and we can get the current tab index afterwards.
  In <CloseTab_EM>, omit code to close debugger as that's now done at the end
    of <CreateTabInThread>.
  Display a number in the tab text to better identify the tab as well as
    so it can be referred to in )COPY.
  Define common function to determine if the current tab is active.

VER.C:
  Widen various strings to simplify code elsewhere.

WORKSPACE.H:
  Switch from separate [Globalxxxs] to one [Globals] so we can
    better handle non-empty SI (though that isn't handled as yet).
