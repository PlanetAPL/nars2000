GETFNS.C:
  Define function to return the next item from a memory ptr as a VFP.

PF_EPSILON.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Fix bug so as call <PrimFnDydEspilonNvV_EM> for VFP v. RAT instead of <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvR_EM>.
  Fix Bug in <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvB>, <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvA>, and <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvP_EM> by calling MPFR functions sensitive to []CT.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvV_EM> by calling above function to convert the next item to VFP instead of assuming that it is always VFP.

PF_IOTA.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Fix bug so as call <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> for RAT v. VFP instead of <PrimFnDydIotaRvN_EM>.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> by calling above function to convert the next item to VFP instead of assuming that it is always VFP.
