* Fix Bug For Embedded Assignment Within An AFO

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnAlpDone> when tokenizing a name in an AFO, first lookup this name
    through the chain of HTS.  If found, use that STE; if not, append the
    name to the global HTS.
  In <fnAsnDone>, if a name is assigned to, ensure that preceding instances
    of that name in the same stmt use the same STE.
