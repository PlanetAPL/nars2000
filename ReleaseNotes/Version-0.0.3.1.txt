Version 0.0.3.1 consists of the following Builds:


Build #878 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Ensure Minimum OS Version Is WinXP

Directory trunk:

MAIN.C:
  Ensure that the OS is at least WinXP.


Build #877 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Use Matrix Inverse Instead Of Matrix Divide In Magic Function For Overdetermined Rational Matrix

Directory trunk:

PF_DOMINO.C:
  The magic function for inverting overdetermined rational matrices
    must use the matrix inverse form instead of matrix divide as
    the version of FLINT we moved back to doesn't solve the system
    of equations.

REBAR.C:
  Include non-multiset definition for Subset and Superset tooltips.


Build #876 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Use Same GMP/MPIR/MPFR Headers As Static Libraries

Directory trunk:

HEADERS.H:
  Include <mpir.h> as it is needed to define <mp_bitcnt_t>.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Set MPIR and MPFR include directories to same files as used
    in the static libraries.


Build #875 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Restore Text Cursor After Changing To Another Tab

Directory trunk:

TABCTRL.C:
  Fix Bug:  Restore text cursor after changing to another tab --
    sometimes it disappears.


Build #874 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Ensure That VFP Modulus Result Is Less Than Modulus

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Don't compile FLINT DEBUG stmts if Win64 (FLINT not available).

INITDATA.C:
  Omit precision save stmts as they are unused.

MPFNS.C:
  Remove Assert stmts as they fail on Win64 DEBUG.
  Fix Bug:  Call <mpf_mod_sub> until the result is less than the modulus
    as the precision limitations might require that.

NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Synchronize the 32- and 64-bit versions.


Build #873 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Type Promotion To RAT As Exception
* Fix Bug:  Handle Missing Cases Due To <pi> Forcing Args To RAT

Directory trunk:

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Fix Bug:  Handle <EXCEPTION_RESULT_RAT> in all exception routines where
    <EXCEPTION_RESULT_VFP> is handled.
  Fix Bug:  Handle missing cases due to <pi> forcing all numeric args to RAT.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>, when the result is a global numeric,
    handle the case where the ptr to result global memory handle is non-NULL, but
    the value is NULL as one in which we need to allocate memory for the result.
  Improve comments.


Build #872 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Fix Memory Overwrite
* Fix Bug:  Fix Memory Leak
* Fix Bug:  Divisor Sum Wrong for Prime 2

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydPiRisRvR>, don't copy the right arg numerator as
    it is changed by <PrimFnPiCommon>.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydPiRisRvR>, free two MPZs at end to avoid memory leak.
  Handle <PrimFnDydPiViaVvV> by converting the MPFs to MPQs and calling
    <PrimFnDydPiRisRvR> directly.
  Fix Bug:  In <ProcessPrime>, the divisor sum is calculated incorrectly for
    the prime 2.


Build #871 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Long Lines, Part II

Directory trunk:

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
