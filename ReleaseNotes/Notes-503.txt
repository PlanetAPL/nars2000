Build #503-- Version 0.0.2.2
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When a workspace is loaded that is newer than the
  current interpreter recognizes, recover without leaving
  handles unlocked and HGLOBALs doubly freed.

Directory trunk:

SC_LOAD.C:
  Fix Bug:  Initialize local var so it has a known value on exit.
  Fix Bug:  If failing a )LOAD on a version mismatch, leave through
    common exit code where locked vars are unlocked.

SESSMAN.C:
  Fix Bug:  If failing a )LOAD on version mismatch, clear after
    freeing the HGLOBAL of the ws name.

TABCTRL.C:
  Use struct value of ws name DPFE in stead of separate local
    as the struct value is updated when the HGLOBAL is freed.
