---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

APLERRORS.H:
  Define new error message for attempt to restart non-restartable code.

COMPRO.H:
  Include new Crash Control module.

EDITFCN.C:
  When Pasting APL chars, deal with text formats only as some of the others
    are problematic (e.g. Enhanced Meta Files).

EXCEPT.C:
  Implement Crash Control window which also displays a BackTrace.

EXECDFN.C:
  Put localization code into a separate function <LocalizeAll> so it can be
    used in multple places.
  Omit local __try/__except code as it's now handled by a global exception handler.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define various Crash Control variables and functions.

GOTO.C:
  Fix bug where an out of range goto target (< 0 or > 0x7FFFFFFF) was incorrectly
    treated as {goto}{zilde}.
  Check for {goto} non-restartable code (signal error message).

IMMEXEC.C:
  When returning from an Immediate Execution Mode statement, if there's an
    active Quad Prompt, remember that fact, and avoid double prompt.
  Pass Restartable flag to <FillSISNxt>.

MAIN.RC:
  Define various Crash Control variables and functions.

MAKEFILE.W32:
MAKEFILE.W64:
  Omit /Ox optimization flag while we're debugging with Crash Control
    as that flag makes backtraces through the stack impossible.
  Include new Crash Control module.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Fix bug where we don't remove the global entry for []DM in the [Globals] section of a saved ws.
  For the SI stack, don't bother listing the local variables as we have that info from other sources.

SC_SI.C:
  If )SI code is called from )SAVE, don't return debug entries.
  Use SECTNAME_SI instead of constant.

SESSMAN.C:
  If a loaded workspace was saved with an outstanding Quad input prompt, check for it on the
    initial load and display an appropriate prompt.

SIS.H:
  Define restartable flag for each SI level.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more addresses for debugging purposes.

WORKSPACE.H:
