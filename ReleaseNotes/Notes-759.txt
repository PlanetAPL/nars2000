* Fix Bug:  Don't Fail Tokenization With Misspelled System Label Name

Directory trunk:

SAVEFCN.C:
  Fix Bug:  If a System Label name is misspelled, we fail <GetSpecialLabelNums>
    and hence, tokenization, whereas we want to succeed (and mark the label
    as a VALUE ERROR) so as to allow the function to be defined.
