Build #1413 -- Version 0.4.11.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Another Bug In []STOP & []TRACE

Directory trunk:

QF_STRACE.C:
  In <SysFnDydSTRACE_EM_YY>, be sure to clear all []STOP or []TRACE flags first (duh!).
  In <TraceLine>, if the current object is invalid or the display of the trace result fails for any reason,
    prepend a blank before the function name/line # so as to align with other trace displays
    and end the line with a CR.
  In <TraceLine>, if we are to free the trace arg, do that first before clearing it (duh!).
