Build #717 -- Version 0.0.2.17
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Display of Precision Overflow Is Syntax Colored Incorrectly

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In the FSA for TKROW_POINTNOT, there's a missing action upon
    encountering an underbar to terminate the Point Notation.
    This causes expressions such as 30 19{format}(divide)3 to
    be syntax colored incorrectly.
