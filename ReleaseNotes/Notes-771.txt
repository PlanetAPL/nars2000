Build #771 -- Version 0.0.2.19
------------------------------

* Change Error Message For 2a3

Directory trunk:

PN_PARSE.Y:
  In <pn_yyerror>, don't increment the caret beyond the last char.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Signal SYNTAX ERROR instead of VALUE ERROR for <2a3> as that's the
    same message for <2_3>.

TYPES.H:
  Add this file as it was missed in the last build.
