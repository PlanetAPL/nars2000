Build #1107 -- Version 0.3.10.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Each When Calculating The Result Rank

Directory trunk:

PO_DIERESIS.C:
  Fix bug introduced in build #1093 where the calculation of the result rank
    was wrong if neither arg is a singleton and the left arg rank is smaller
    than the right arg rank.
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
