Build #621 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Trains Via An Invisible Monadic Operator

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  When creating the ListBox in the Debug window, switch from owner-draw
    fixed to variable and handle WM_MEASUREITEM so we can change the line
    height when the font changes.

DISPDBG.C:
  In <DisplayFcnGlb>, mark globals with an asterisk if they have the
    SRCI flag set.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, avoid display of invisible Train monadic operator.
  Remove unnecessary cast.
  In <DisplayStrand>, mark globals with an asterisk if they have the
    SRCI flag set.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <UnlocalizeSTEs>, handle the case where a SYMENTRY to be unlocalized
    is a Train.

EXECFNS.C:
  In <ExecFcnGlb_EM>, skip over invisible Train monadic operator.
  In <ExecOp1_EM_YY>, handle invisible Train monadic operator.

FREE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <FreeResultGlobalDFLV>, simplify the code.

NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Omit <compro.h> from the build so as to reduce the # times the whole
    project gets rebuilt.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  When initializing a Train, always start with an invisible monadic
    operator, and include it in the count.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <CopyArray_EM>, when copying function arrays, increment the RefCnt
    iff the item is a UDFO; otherwise, make a fresh copy of the item.
  In <Set/ClrVFOArraySRCIFlag>, check for immediates and just return
    because otherwise <GetGlobalPtrs_LOCK> won't handle them well.
  Define <GetVFOArraySRCIFlag> to return the state of the SRCI flag
    for use in <dispdbg.c>.

SESSMAN.C:
  When debugging, change the relative heights of the DB and SM windows.

STRAND.C:
  Remove unnecessary cast.
  Remove unused last parameter to <YYCopyFcn>.
  In <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY>, rename some vars and reformat the code.
  Define new routine to make a Train monadic operator.

UNICODE.H:
  Define index for invisible Train monadic operator.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, use existing function to determine whether or not
    a token type is that of a named Fcn or Opr, and rename some vars.
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, for function arrays, split cases between UDFOs
    function strands, and Trains handling them differently so as to
    match the way those are handled in <YYCopyFcn>.
  In <YYIsFcnStrAxis>, omit the unused last parameter, rename some vars,
    handle the case where the function base is invalid,
  In <YYCopyFcn>, rename some vars, recurse through function strands
    but not UDFOs nor Trains, and add into the token count result rather
    than assigning to it so as to allow the caller to use the same var
    when accumulating over multiple items.
  Omit <IncrFcnTkn> and <IncrFcnMem> as they are not longer called.
