Build #507-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When a named function array is used in a statement and an error
  is signalled because of something in that named function array (e.g. AXIS ERROR),
  rebase the character indices for all tokens in the function array to that of the
  named function so as to have the caret point to the named function with the error.

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Pass additional parameter to <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY> to indicate hwether or not
    we should rebase the function tokens if the named function is a function
    array.
  In <pl_yylex/case TKT_OP1IMMED:>, remove unnecessary code.

STRAND.C:
  Pass additional parameter to <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY> to indicate hwether or not
    we should rebase the function tokens if the named function is a function
    array.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, count the individual tokens in a function array.
  In <YYCopyFcn>, copy the individual tokens in a function array and
    save them at the top level in the result rather than just point to the
    function array global memory handle.
  In <IncrFcnMem>, handle immediate axis values.
