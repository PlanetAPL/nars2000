* Scroll Text Caret Into View Upon Window Activation

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
SESSMAN.C:
  Scroll the text caret into view upon window activation.


Build #1611 -- Version 0.4.19.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In Dyadic Epsilon And Iota Code

Directory trunk:

CONVERT.C:
  Fix typo in comment.

PF_EPSILON.C:
  Merge dyadic epsilon code with the code from NewTypes to use TPA_ routines
    which greatly simplifies and reduces the code volume.

PF_IOTA.C:
  Merge dyadic iota code with the code from NewTypes to use TPA_ routines
    which greatly simplifies and reduces the code volume.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Append comment to MyGlobalLockXXX lines to indicate that the suffix is not needed.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  Fix bugs in TPA_xxx routines to handle the case where the input and output args overlap.


Build #1610 -- Version 0.4.19.xx
--------------------------------

* In New Tab Show )XLOAD or )LOAD As Appropriate

Directory trunk:

SC_LOAD.C:
  In <LoadWorkspace_EM>, save the incoming []LX flag and use to display the proper load command in the new workspace.

TABCTRL.C:
  Delete the separate []LX flag in favor of the one already in <SM_CREATESTRUCTW>.


Build #1609 -- Version 0.4.19.xx
--------------------------------

* Merge Epsilon And Iota Code With NewTypes

Directory trunk:

PF_EPSILON.C:
PF_IOTA.C:
  Merge Epsilon and Iota code with NewTypes.


Build #1608 -- Version 0.4.19.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Dyadic Epsilon On RAT/VFP v. Booleans With []CT = 0
* Fix Bug In Dyadic Epsilon On VFP v. RAT
* Fix Bug In Dyadic Iota    On RAT v. VFP

Directory trunk:

GETFNS.C:
  Define function to return the next item from a memory ptr as a VFP.

PF_EPSILON.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Fix bug so as call <PrimFnDydEspilonNvV_EM> for VFP v. RAT instead of <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvR_EM>.
  Fix Bug in <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvB>, <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvA>, and <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvP_EM> by calling MPFR functions sensitive to []CT.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydEpsilonNvV_EM> by calling above function to convert the next item to VFP instead of assuming that it is always VFP.

PF_IOTA.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Fix bug so as call <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> for RAT v. VFP instead of <PrimFnDydIotaRvN_EM>.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> by calling above function to convert the next item to VFP instead of assuming that it is always VFP.

VER.RC:
  Increment version # to 0.4.19.xx.
