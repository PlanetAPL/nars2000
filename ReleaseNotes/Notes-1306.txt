Build #1306 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Replace A Function With Its Expanded Equivalent

Directory trunk:

FREE.C:
STARTADDR.H:
  Delete <FreeYYFcn1> as it is not longer used.

PARSELINE.C:
  Replace <FreeYYFcn1> in favor of the expanded version so we can more easily see what's happening.
  In most calls to <PushFcnStrand_YY>, use <IsFcnStrDirect> instead of a constant.
  In <ParseLine> when setting <rht2SynObj>, avoid Asserting as sometimes it's invalid.

PL_PROC.C:
  Replace <FreeYYFcn1> in favor of the expanded version so we can more easily see what's happening.
