Build #648 -- Version 0.0.2.11
------------------------------

* Before Saving a Function Ensure The Old Object Is Also A Function

Directory trunk:

APLERRORS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new error message for SI DAMAGE.

EXECMFN.C:
  In <GetSpecialLabelNums>, include new parameter for Edit Ctrl
    window handle.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Improve comments.
  Convert <MessageBox> calls to Unicode.
  After displaying a Message Box, set the focus to the parent
    of the Edit Ctrl window.
  Before displaying a Message Box, split cases depending upon
    whether or not we're not called from the Master Frame.
  Before saving a function, check to see if the old object is
    also a function and thus can be overwritten by the new one.
  In <GetSpecialLabelNums> pass down the Edit Ctrl window
    handle so we can use it to set the focus on an error.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.2.11.
