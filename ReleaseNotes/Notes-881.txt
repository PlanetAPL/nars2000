* Fix Bug:  Set Precision Of VFP Constants Based On # Digits

Directory trunk:

PN_PARSE.Y:
  In <PN_MakeVfpPoint>, calculate the # significant bits in the number and
    set the precision to the larger of that and the current precision so as
    not to under-represent the precision of a constant.
