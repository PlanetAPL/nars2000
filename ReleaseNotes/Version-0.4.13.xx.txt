  When producing a prototype file, don't bother to display the filename.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedNAM_SPNF>, if the function is an AFO, assign it as a NF rather than evaluate it as a var.

    is an AFO and the right arg column dimension is empty or a singleton.

PO_DOT.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <PrimOpMonDotCommon_EM_YY> for -.x on FLTs, fix bug which doesn't copy all of the right arg for GSL to work on.
  In <PrimOpMonDotCommon_EM_YY> prior to calling <GaussJordanDet>, merge loops for efficiency.


Build #1452 -- Version 0.4.13.xx
--------------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
AXISFNS.C:
DISPDBG.C:
DISPLAY.C:
PO_DOT.C:
PO_JOTDOT.C:
TYPEMOTE.C:
  Use macro when reading <tkLongest> or <tkGlbData> in case the token is named.

EXECDFN.C:
  Use macro when reading <tkLongest> or <tkGlbData> in case the token is named.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.

GETFNS.C:
  Use macro when reading <tkLongest> or <tkGlbData> in case the token is named.

PF_INDEX.C:
PF_SQUAD.C:

Directory trunk:

SYSVARS.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock> and elsewhere.
  Fix bug in <ValidateIntegerVector_EM> (used by []FEATURE and []IC) if the right arg is BOOL.


Build #1450 -- Version 0.4.13.xx
--------------------------------

* Handle Decimal/Exponentiation Form In Denominator Of Rational Point Notation

Directory trunk:

CR_PROC.C:

PN_PARSE.H:
PN_PARSE.Y:
  Define and set flags to deal with rational numbers in strings.

PN_PROC.C:
  Use <mpfr_strtofr> instead of <mpfr_set_str> when the string isn't zero-terminated.
  In <PN_NumCalc>, set FLT flag as appropriate.
  In <PN_NumCalc>, call <mpq_init_set_str2> to convert string to a rational number and
    deal with the return code.
  In <PN_VectorAcc> and <PN_VectorRes>, set and test flags to deal with rational numbers in strings.
