* Improve Text In Language Bar; Overcome Windows Bug

Directory trunk:

REBAR.C:
  Improve text in language bar for Lev, Dex, Underbar, and Quad.
  Reorganize language bar to put operators next to each other.
  Overcome Windows API bug with TTM_SETTITLE in that it uses a font
    that can't be changed and doesn't display all chars.  Instead, I
    rolled my own title.

UNICODE.H:
  Define additional Line Drawing Characters.
