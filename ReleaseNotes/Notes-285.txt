Build #285 -- Version 0.0.0.18399
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Define yet another debugging function, this one for
    displaying a YYRes struc.

EXCEPT.C:
  If a user encounters a DbgStop, the address reported points to DbgStop
    which isn't very helpful.  If a breakpoint exception occurs, we display
    the return address for DbgStop instead which at least gives us a better
    chance of figuring out where the bug lies.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define and use value for <DEF_DEFAULTPASTE>.

INIFILE.C:
  Read in and write out [Options] section.

MAKEPRO.C:
  Handle lines to be deleted if  they begin with "__forceinline"
    as they do for /Wp64 (and possibly _WIN64).

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more addresses for debugging purposes.

STRAND.C:
  Fix bug:  A subtle error (Lint would have helped) returned an ptr
    to a struct no longer on the stack.

UNITRANSTAB.H:
  Fix typo in PC/3270 source char for Z_.


Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Fix bug in EDIT_EM_ReplaceSel in the case where the parent doesn't
    always increase the buffer limit enough on overflow (NARS always
    increases it enough).

WORKSPACE.H:
  No changes other than white space.
