Build #353 -- Version 0.0.1.11
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
  As part of linking HshTab and SymTabs, pass a ptr to various functions
    (<HshTabFrisk>, <DisplayHshTab>, etc.) instead of a Boolean flag which
    simplifies the logic of each such function.
  Pass new Boolean argument to <DisplayFcnStrand> to indicate whether
    or not to display the header so we can use this function in a non-
    DEBUG context.

COMPRO.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Include prototype file for new file <qf_fmt.c>.

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Fix Bug:  I defined the <glbSameFontAs> array and allowed the user
    to modify it, however I didn't get around to hooking it into the
    rest of the system.  This change fixes that as well as adds more
    code to separate defining the changed fonts and applying them.
  Fix Bug:  When changing from BG not transparent to transparent, the
    old non-transparent color is left in place thus obviating the change.

DEFINES.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Delete <DEF_TEXT_xG_COLOR> in favor of <gSyntaxColorBG>.
  Rename xxxSIZE equates/vars to xxxNELM to reflect their units properly.
  Also, double the WFORMAT size as some character arrays with embedded
    CR,LFs won't display (LIMIT ERROR).

DISPDBG.C:
  As part of linking HshTab and SymTabs, pass a ptr to various functions
    (<HshTabFrisk>, <DisplayHshTab>, etc.) instead of a Boolean flag which
    simplifies the logic of each such function.
  Rename xxxSIZE equates/vars to xxxNELM to reflect their units properly.
  Modify <DisplayFcnStrand> so it can be called in a non-DEBUG context.
  Move <DisplayFcnLine> from <execdfn.c> to <dispdbg.c> where it properly
    belongs.

DISPLAY.C:
  Rename xxxSIZE equates/vars to xxxNELM to reflect their units properly.

EDITFCN.C:
  Allow Function Lines to be syntax colored.

    and <GetFSIndAveCharSize> to get the appropriate font handle and
    average char size.
  Rename xxxSIZE equates/vars to xxxNELM to reflect their units properly.
  Define global brush for painting a window background and return its
    handle to <WM_CTLCOLOREDIT>.

    pointing to unprotected memory.
  Rename <gSyntaxColorWhite> to <gSyntaxColorBG> to better reflect its
    purpose.
  Fix Bug:  The mouse cursor should change from arrow to hourglass when
    the program is executing and back to an arrow when idle.  My first
    attempt at that didn't work until I figured out the importance of

EXCEPT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Include <dbghelp.h> to pick up <StackWalk64> equates and strucs.
  Move exception info from the <PerTabData> structure to globals as

    store it per tab.
  Delete various routines which set and read the previous PerTabData
    exception info in favor of referencing the global themselves.
  Include debug message when exceeding a memory lmit so we know which
    memory element was too short.
  Use <StackWalk64> instead of my home grown version.

EXECDFN.C:
  Fix Bug:  The mouse cursor should change from arrow to hourglass when
    the program is executing and back to an arrow when idle.  My first
