Build #733 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Release Semaphore On )RESET

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  Zero semaphore handle in PerTabData struc just in case anyone looks at it.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, when returning from a )RESET, if
    there's a pending exit semaphore, release it.  Without this fix,
    closing a tab with a suspended function can wait forever for the
    hExitphore semaphore to be released.

MAKEPRO.PHP:
  Strip out "static ..." lines.

TABCTRL.C:
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCM_DELETEITEM>, close the handle as we done with
    this tab.
