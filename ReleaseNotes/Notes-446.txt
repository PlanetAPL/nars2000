------------------------------

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Save Customize dialog handle in global for later testing.
  Zap Customize global handle in WM_DESTROY to indicate that the
    dialog is no longer active.

EDITFCN.C:
  In <LclEditCtrlWndProc>, don't call <SetStatusXXX> if our parent is MF.
  In <LclEditCtrlWndProc>, handle VK_INSERT so as to allow Replace
    Mode in Customize dialog's Edit Ctrls.
  In <InsRepCharStr>, allow INS/REP to work if parent is not MF
    (e.g., Customize dialog).

EXTERNS.H:
  Define global to hold the Customize dialog handle if it is active.
