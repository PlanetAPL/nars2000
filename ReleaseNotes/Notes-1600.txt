Build #1600 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug With Storing INT_MIN As A VFPO Number

Directory trunk:

FREE.C:
  Fix typo in comment.

HEADERS.H:
  Delete "#undef mpfr_set_sj" as we don't launder it ourselves.

MACROS.H:
  Use consistent naming convention for 64-bit integers with MPFR with a suffix of "_sx" and "_ux" instead of "_sj" and "uj".

MPIFNS.C:
  Delete our implementation of <mpfr_set_sx> in favor of calling <mpfr_set_sj> as ours has a bug with INT_MIN.
  Redo our <mpfr_get_sx> to call <mpfr_get_sj>.
