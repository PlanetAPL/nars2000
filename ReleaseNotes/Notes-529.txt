* Fix Bugs in Rank Operator

Directory trunk:

PO_DIJOT.C:
  Fix Bug:  If the result of <#MonRank> or <#DydRank> consists of
    mixed rank items, the Axis Operator to the Rank Operator was
    ignored.
  Fix Bug:  In <#MonRank>, if the right operand to the Rank Operator
    was a two-element vector, the wrong cell size was used.
