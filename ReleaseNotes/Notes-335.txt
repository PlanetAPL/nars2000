MAKEDEP.PHP:
  Rewrite <depscan.exe> as a PHP script (which speeds it up
    considerably).

MAKEFILE.DEP:
  Define new makefile to generate <dep.txt> which is !included
    in <makefile.inc> to import and the .dep files.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Remove dependency on <PCRE> environment variable.

  Fix Bug:  In <PrimOpDydSlashCommon_EM_YY> (dyadic slash), the
    index into the result is calculated incorrectly.  As the result
    is generated sequentially in row major order, we need only
    increment a variable starting from zero.

PRIMFNS.C:

  Move .h files into <headers.h> for <makepro.php>.
  Set the Ins key on startup to the .ini file saved value
    and tell the Status Bar window about it.
  Improve comments.
  When the SM window is up and running, tell the Master Frame
    to resize itself (to the same size) and thus show/hide the
    Status Bar Window.
  When the SM window is up and running, repaint the Status Window
    and tell it about the new positions.
  Include new arg to <ActivateMDIMenu> to specify the position
    of the View menu.
  When debugging and initializing the DB/SM windows take into
    account the Status Window if it's visible.

  Add/delete some references.

  In <CreateNewTab>, save the thread ID for later use when we
    close the tab.
  In <PointToWsName>, use temp var for L"  CLEAR WS" so the
    circled number can be written into it.  VC Express puts
    such vars into a read-only section so we can't write into
    it directly.

THREADS.H:
  Define new entry in struct for the thread ID.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Move .h files into <headers.h> for <makepro.php>.

    to test for re-entrancy.
  Handle +/- Infinity as Point Notation.
  Delete references to unused pertab vars.
  Handle detection of local names in function header.
  Improve comments.
  Fix Bug:  In <fnAlpDone>, initialize <bRet> in case we're
    called from <SyntaxColor>.
  Remove <fnInfinity> as it's now handled as Point Notation.
  Fix Bug:  In <fnComDone>, if we're called in the middle of
    the Edit Ctrl buffer we need to use the smallwe of
    <lstrlenW> and the first occurrence of CR/LF.
  Define new action <fnSyntPrm> to mark a syntax color as
    that of a primitive function.
  In <Tokenize_EM>, use Critical Section Object to avoid
    re-entrancy problems.

  In <onFocusAPL>, handle null <iconsize> because that attribute
    isn't defined.
  Rename <gAPLObserver> to <gPrefObserverAPL> to reflect its use
    as an observer of preference changes.
  In <gPrefObserverAPL>, handle changew to "customize" to
    initialize the image state.
