Build #923 -- Version 0.0.3.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bugs In Factoring Code

Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Define common struc for factoring code.

PF_PI.C:
  Define initial and incremental counts when allocating and
    re-allocating temp memory to hole prime factors.
  Replace use of fixed size virtual memory temp for prime factors
    with variable size global memory temp.
  In <PrimFnMonPi_EM_YY>, check the return of <PrimFnPiCommon> for
    multiple errors.
  In <PrimFnPiCommon>, set the result to a known value in case we fail.
  In <PrimFnPiCommon>, simplify the code for when we find a factor, and
    resize the factor struc, too, if necessary.
  In <PrimFnPiCommon>, don't free <aplTmp> until the end in case we
    signal an error.
  Define separate routine to resize the factor struc as necessary.
