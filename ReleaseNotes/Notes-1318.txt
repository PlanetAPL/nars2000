Build #1318 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In []EA/[]EC

Directory trunk:

PARSELINE.C:
  In <ParseLine>/PARSELINE_DONE, when checking for a function to release (and return NOVALUE),
    exclude the naked {goto} case as the ExitType has already been set to RESET_ONE.

QF_EA.C:
  Set EC bit for []EA as that bit is checked when considering whether or not to suspend []EA's caller.
