* Fix Bug:  The Status Window isn't properly hidden under certain
  circumstances

Directory trunk:

MAIN.C:
  Fix Bug:  The content of the Status Window is updated as necessary,
    but if it's hidden, it still displays partially.  This change
    uses a common message to update the status and then hide the window
    as appropriate.
