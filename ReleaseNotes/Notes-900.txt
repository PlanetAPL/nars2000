Build #900 -- Version 0.0.3.3
-----------------------------

* Optimize Some Number-Theoretic Functions

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  In <FormatAplRatFC>, don't canonicalize unless trhe denominator is NE 1.

MPFNS.C:
  In <mpz_set_sa>/<mpq_set_sa>, handle set to zero specially so we don't
    overallocate the number.

PF_BAR.C:
PF_COLONBAR.C:
PF_STAR.C:
  Delete call to <mpz_canonicalize> as this functions can't create
    un-canonicalized numbers.

PF_PI.C:
  In <PrimFnDydPiRisRvR>/<PrimFnDydPiVisVvV>, catch raised exceptions from
    below so we can clear the local global numerics we create along the way.
  In <PrimFnPiNthPrime>, call common routine <NthPrime> that uses previous
    information to optimize its performance.
  In <PrimFnPiNumPrime>, call common routine <NumPrimes> that uses previous
    information to optimize its performance.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Clear the exception code for WS FULL.
