Build #1477 -- Version 0.4.14.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In AFO With Query Primitive Not Changing Global Value Of []RL

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  Save Localized []RL flag in State Indicator Stack.
  Save ptr to previous HSHTABSTR in SIS.

EXECMFN.H:
  Define shorthand for []RL text.

FH_PARSE.H:
  Define Localized []RL bit in two strucs.

FH_PARSE.Y:
  In <fh_yylex>, set Localized []RL flag as appropriate.

GETFNS.C:
  Rename <QuadRL> to <uQuadRL> to reflect its datatype.
  In <RestPrimSpecRL>, if the value to save is new, pass it on up the line to more
    global HSHTABSTRs for which []RL is not localized in case we're in an AFO.

PF_QUERY.C:
PRIMSPEC.H:
  Rename <QuadRL> to <uQuadRL> to reflect its datatype.

SAVEFCN.C:
  In <SaveFunctionCom>, pass Localized []RL flag from <fh_parse> to the UDFO header.
  In <SaveFunctionCom>, if we're in an AFO, pass the Localize []RL flag to the UDFO header.

SAVEFCN.H:
  In <tagSF_FCNS> struc, define a Localized []RL flag.

SIS.H:
  In <tagSIS_HEADER>, define a Lcalized []RL flag.
  In <tagSIS_HEADER>, define a ptr to the previous HSHTABSTR.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnAsnDone>, if the []var being assigned to is []RL, set a Localized []RL flag in <tagSF_FCNS> struc.
