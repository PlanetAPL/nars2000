* Fix Bug:  Handle Empty Right Arg And Non-Zero Left Arg To Partitioned Enclose

Directory trunk:

PF_LSHOE.C:
  In <PrimFnDydLeftShoeGlb_EM>, if the left arg is a non-zero
    simple scalar, and the right arg is empty along the specified
    (or implied) axis, the result should be empty as the left arg
    is extended to be an empty vector.
