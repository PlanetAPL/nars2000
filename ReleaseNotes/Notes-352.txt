Build #352 -- Version 0.0.1.10
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

CS_PARSE.Y:
  Fix typo in comments.

CS_PROC.C:
  Fix Bug:  Replace <YYResExec> with <YYCaseExec> as the former is used
    to pass on execute results and can conflict with its use in
    <CS_PROC.C>.
  In <CS_Done_FOR>, use the same routine to free the token as it used
    in <GetNextValueTokenIntoNamedVarToken>.
  Fix Bug:  In <CS_FOR_Stmt_EM>, the reference count for <tkForArr>
    isn't incremented by <CopySymGlbDir> when it's an LPSYMENTRY.  Use
    <CopyToken_EM> instead.
  Fix Bug:  In <CS_FOR_Stmt_EM>, use canonical NoValue STE rather than
    construct one on the spot as the <IsSymNoValue> macro is very
    particular.
  Remove extraneous qualifier in comment.

EDITFCN.C:
  Fix Bug:  Move declaration of <hGlbNum>, <hGlbStr>, and associated
    vars from <pertab.h> to <tokenize.h> so it is specific to the run
    through the tokenization routines rather than global.  This also
    entails other changes such as passing <lptkLocalvars> to routines
    so they may refer to the above vars in their new location.
  Allocate space for numeric and string temp save areas within each call
    to <SyntaxColor> or <Tokenize_EM> rather than global.
  Delete temporary code to try to use the clipping region to write the
    entire line.

ERRMSG.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.
  In <ErrorMessageDirect>, unwind SI levels in order to find
    proper level for error message.

EXECDFN.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Initialize exit type in case we don't execute any lines.
  After executing a function, check the exit type for reset one
    and all and none.  If none, check for unassigned result vars
    and handle appropriately.
  In <CheckDfnExitError_EM>, find the SI level of the nearest
    user-defined function/opreator.  If there's an error, mark the
    SI levels we skipped over as to be unwound in order to format
    the error message.
  Merge common SYNTAX ERROR code.

EXTERNS.H:
  Move declaration of <fastBoolFns> from <fastbool.c> to <externs.h>
    so other files can reference it without an extern stmt.

FASTBOOL.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Move declaration of <fastBoolFns> from <fastbool.c> to <externs.h>
    so other files can reference it without an extern stmt.

GETFNS.C:
  Fix Bug:  As it turns out, empty Integer and Float arrays are
    possible, so we need to handle them properly.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Renumber all MYWM_QUOTEQUAD lParams for simplicity when searching
    for them as well as when adding a new one.  This change is for
    DEBUG purposes only.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, skip back over SI levels of ImmExec.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread> after returning <EXITTYPE_ERROR> from
    <ParseLine>, do not display the Quad prompt as that'll happen
    after executing []ELX.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread> after returning <EXITTYPE_NODISPLAY> or
    <EXITTYPE+_NOVALUE> from <ParseLine>, if the caller is Quad
    input and there's no value, tell SM re-display the Quad input
    prompt.

MACROS.H:
  Loosen the definition of <IsSymNoValue> to just <.Value EQ FALSE>.

PERTAB.H:
  Fix Bug:  Move declaration of <hGlbNum>, <hGlbStr>, and associated
    vars from <pertab.h> to <tokenize.h> so it is specific to the run
    through the tokenization routines rather than global.  This also
    entails other changes such as passing <lptkLocalvars> to routines
    so they may refer to the above vars in their new location.
  Define <YYCaseExec> to hold the result from a <:CASE> stmt.

PF_CSTILE.C:
  Fix Bug:  if the left arg is empty there's no storage to allocate
    for <hGlbRot>.  As W doesn't like anyone to lock empty memory
    (what a stupid choice on their part), we need to check for it
    and take alternate action.

PF_RSHOE.C:
  Demote result of I{pick}R for right arg global memory handle.

PF_SLASH.C:
  Fix Bug:  The test for empty was on the right arg not the result.
    Moreover, we were returning the right arg not its prototype.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Change the result of <PrimFnUpTackJotCSPLParse> from <DWORD> to
    <EXIT_TYPES> to provide a wider range for testing.
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotPLParse>, if there's no result from
    <ParseLine>, and the exit type is <EXITTYPE_NODISPLAY>,
    change the exit type to <EXITTYPE_NOVALUE>.
    a function token for error caret display.
  After calling <ParseLine>, if there's no result, return a
    NoValue result.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Define save area for token count of the line being parsed.

PL_PARSE.PROTO:
  Define prototypes for two new routines in <pl_parse.y>.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define <YYERROR3> to handle <YYERROR2> and set the exit type to
    <EXITTYPE_ERROR> and use it instead of <YYERROR2> everywhere
    except if <lpplLocalVars->bLookAhead EQ TRUE>.
  Delete Control Structures from ToDo list as they've been done.
  In <StmtMult:> define rule for error with one or more diamonds.
  In <StmtSing:> skip calling <ArrExprCheckCaller> unless the current
    stmt is the last one on the line.
  In <SingVar:> when handling Quad input, if we're resetting, YYACCEPT
    the line so we don't execute anything else.
  In <ParseLine>, save the line's token count in <plLocalVars> for
    later use.
  In <ParseLine>, delete commented out code.
  In <WaitForInput>, if there's no result return a NoValue token.
  In <AmbOpSwap> change the error message from SYNTAX to NONCE to
    remind someone to fix it later.
  In <ArrExprCheckCaller>, remove the check for Quad input if the
    result has no value as that case no longer applies.
  Define routines to determine if a given stmt is the last one on
    the line.

PO_SLASH.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Remove extern reference to <fastBoolFns> as it's now in <externs.h>.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <FillSISNxt>, note set of <Unwind> bit.

SESSMAN.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  Move declaration of <hGlbNum>, <hGlbStr>, and associated
    vars from <pertab.h> to <tokenize.h> so it is specific to the run
    through the tokenization routines rather than global.  This also
    entails other changes such as passing <lptkLocalvars> to routines
    so they may refer to the above vars in their new location.
  Reformat line.
  Renumber all MYWM_QUOTEQUAD lParams for simplicity when searching
    for them as well as when adding a new one.  This change is for
    DEBUG purposes only.

SIS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define bit to indicate that this SI level is to be unwound for
    the proper formatting of the error message.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Fix Bug:  Move declaration of <hGlbNum>, <hGlbStr>, and associated
    vars from <pertab.h> to <tokenize.h> so it is specific to the run
    through the tokenization routines rather than global.  This also
    entails other changes such as passing <lptkLocalvars> to routines
    so they may refer to the above vars in their new location.
  Fix Bug:  Move code to set syntax colors for Ctrl Strucs from
    <CtrlStrucCmpi> to <fnCtrlDone> as the former is called whenever
    a colon is scanned even if it's inside a quoted string.  This
    avoids overwriting the SyntaxColor buffer.
  In <Tokenize_EM>, move call to <AppendEOSToken> until after <uChar>
    has been set so it can be used in the EOS token data.
  Fix Bug:  Remove call to append Ctrl Strucs :return and :goto
    from the CS stack as they may appear anywhere and mess up the
    existing logic in <cs_parse.y>.

TOKENIZE.H:
  Fix Bug:  Move declaration of <hGlbNum>, <hGlbStr>, and associated
    vars from <pertab.h> to <tokenize.h> so it is specific to the run
    through the tokenization routines rather than global.  This also
    entails other changes such as passing <lptkLocalvars> to routines
    so they may refer to the above vars in their new location.


Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  In <EDIT_AdjustFormatRect>, increment <vlc> by one so as to write the
    last (partial) line.
  In <EDIT_WM_Paint2>, account for last (partial) line when calculating <nLOP>.
  In <EDIT_WM_Paint2>, break out <es->y_offset + > from <min> macro.
