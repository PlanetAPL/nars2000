PRIMSPEC.C:
QF_TYPE.C:
  Rename prototype vars to reflect that they might be LPSYMENTRYs.
  Change the behavior of <MakeMonPrototype_EM> and <MakeDydPrototype_EM>
    to expect the ptr type bits to be set on input and to set them on
    output as appropriate.

PF_SLASH.C:
  Rename prototype vars to reflect that they might be LPSYMENTRYs.
  Change the behavior of <MakeMonPrototype_EM> and <MakeDydPrototype_EM>
    to expect the ptr type bits to be set on input and to set them on
    output as appropriate.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydSlash_EM_YY> for 0/{enclose}{zilde} the prototype
    is calculated on the right arg to slash instead of its first element.

PF_SLOPE.C:
  Rename prototype vars to reflect that they might be LPSYMENTRYs.
  Change the behavior of <MakeMonPrototype_EM> and <MakeDydPrototype_EM>
    to expect the ptr type bits to be set on input and to set them on
    output as appropriate.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydSlope_EM_YY> for 1 0 1\12 {zilde} the prototype
    is calculated on the result of <GetFirstValueToken> which, if the
    arg is empty, returns the prototype instead of the LPSYMENTRY/HGLOBAL.

PO_SLASH.C:
  In <PrimOpMonSlashScalar_EM_YY>, remove arg to ptr to ptr to right arg
    global memory as we lock the ptr inside that function as needed.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimOpMonSlashCommon_EM_YY> for +/0 1{rho}'' pass the
    right arg NELM to the storage type calculator so it can allow the char
    arg because it's empty.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimOpMonSlashScalar_EM_YY> for +/{each}0{rho}{enclose}{enclose}{zilde}
    the prototype is calculated on the right arg instead of its first element.

PO_SLOPE.C:
  In <PrimOpMonSlashScalar_EM_YY>, remove arg to ptr to ptr to right arg
    global memory as we lock the ptr inside that function as needed.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Rename prototype vars to reflect that they might be LPSYMENTRYs.
  Change the behavior of <MakeMonPrototype_EM> and <MakeDydPrototype_EM>
    to expect the ptr type bits to be set on input and to set them on
    output as appropriate.
  In <CopyArray_EM>, clear the ptr type bits on input.
