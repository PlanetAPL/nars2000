-----------------------------

* Display The Default Prompt More Centrally

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  Append new struc entry for use in <WaitForimmExecStmt>.
  In <WaitForImmExecStmt>, if there's no next level to be
    signalled, display the default prompt.
  In <ImmExecStmt>, pass on to <WaitForImmExecStmt> the Edit
    Ctrl window handle so it can be used to display the default
    prompt.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, remove code which displays the
    default prompt as well as related code as that's now done
    more centrally.
  In <ActOnError>, if the result of executing []ELX is DISPLAY
    or NODISPLAY and there's a result in <YYResExec>, display it.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCommon_EM_YY>, handle the case of
    EXITTYPE_RETURNxLX.
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse>, don't display the default
    prompt as that's now done more centrally.
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotPLParse>, clean up the code.
  Remove unnecessary cast.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  If the return from "LeftOper ArrExpr" is from executing []ELX,
    abort execution as the result has been displayed.
  In <ParseLine>, move duplicate declarations to the top so
    they may be used commonly.
  In <ParseLine> after executing the line, handle the
    EXITTYPE_RETURNxLX case.
  In <ParseLine>, don't restore the previous value of <PlLocalVars>
    until after executing []ALX or []ELX so it may be used by
    that code.
  In <ParseLine> after executing []ALX/[]ELX if the result is
    DISPLAY or NODISPLAY and there's a result in <YYResExec>,
    display it.
  In <ParseLine>, don't display the default prompt as that's now
    done more centrally.
  Improve comments.
