Build #546 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  As part of the change to the binding strength for arrays
  and indexed lists an array was freed when it shouldn't have been.

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <IndexVarBR: IndexListBR SingVar> if an error occurs, do not
    free <SingVar> as it gets freed later.
