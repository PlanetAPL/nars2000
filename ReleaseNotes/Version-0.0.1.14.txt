Build #419 -- Version 0.0.1.14
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <CreateFcnWindow>, when about to create a Function Editor window,
    first check to see if the same function name is open for editing;
    if it is, switch to that window instead of opening a new one.
  In <FEWndProc>/<WM_CREATE>, at the very end, link the new window handle
    into the doubly-linked chain of FE window handles.
  In <FEWndProc>/<MYWM_CMPNAME>, compare the incoming function name
    against this window's function name.
  In <FEWndProc>/<WM_DESTROY>, unlink this window handle from the
    doubly-linked chain of FE window handles.
  Define new routine <GetFunctionName> extracted from and now called
    by <SetFETitle> to fill in the FE window's function name and return
    its length.

MAIN.H:
  Define two new extra byte offsets for FE window class to hold the
    forward abd backward window handles in the doubly-linked chain.
  Define a new window message to allow the caller to ask the FE window
    to compare a given function name with that window's function name.

PERTAB.H:
  Define a new struct member to hold the FE windows doubly-linked list
    anchor.

Build #417 -- Version 0.0.1.14
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

    has been changed.

EXTERNS.H:

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  Fix Bug:  Handle more cases where we should indicate Precision Loss.

FMTSPEC.C:
  Allow single and double quote marks as text delimiters.
  Fix bug:  In <fnSetModO>, handle specific value with a fractional part.
  Allow L Qualifier for A-format (code already there to support it,
    just didn't allow it).
  Allow Repetition Factor on X-format.

FMTSPEC.H:
  Rename <SYMSUB_E_CHAR> to <SYMSUB_EXPONENT_SEP> to better reflect
    its usage.

QF_FMT.C:
  Allow Repetition factor on X-format.
  Fix Bug:  When adding text for P- or Q-decorators, include zero
    in the comparison.
  Fix Bug:  Include Precision Loss character in Symbol Substitution
    test loop.
  Rename <SYMSUB_E_CHAR> to <SYMSUB_EXPONENT_SEP> better to reflect
    its usage.
  Fix Bug:  In <QFMT_SubstValue> when there's a match with a float
    value, the wrong variable had the offset applied to it (handled
    correctly for integer values).

Directory trunk:

SC_LOAD.C:
