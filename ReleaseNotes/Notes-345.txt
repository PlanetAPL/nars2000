Build #345 -- Version 0.0.1.3
-----------------------------

Directory trunk:

DATATYPE.H:
  Update the copyright year.
  Mask the low-order bit only in LPSYMENTRYs/HGLOBALs so as to work
    under Wine.

MACROS.H:
  Update the copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  Handle NULL ptr arg as this is used in Dyadic Epsilon
    with both args as simple scalar.
  In <GetPtrTypeDir/Ind>, rename <PTRTYPE_AVAIL> to <PTRTYPE_LENGTH>
    as we now use only one low-order bit in LPSYMENTRYs/HGLOBALs.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Display line before compiling C programs.


NARS2000.VCPROJ:
  Change default struct alignment to one byte.

PERTAB.H:
  Update the copyright year.
  Delete <aplInteger> in struct as we no longer use it.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Update the copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  A certain mixture of Reach and Scatter indexed assignment
    didn't work because a Reach element in the index list was incorrectly
    treated as a Scatter index element.

PN_PARSE.H:
  Update the copyright year.
  Define Boolean numeric type as a possible result from Point Notation.
  Improve comments.

PN_PARSE.Y:
  Update the copyright year.
  Define macro to test for Boolean/Integer type.
  Define Boolean numeric type as a possible result from Point Notation.
  If the Integer result is Boolean-valued, mark as Boolean type.
  Convert Integer result to float in case we need it later because of
    an overflow or conversion.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Update the copyright year.
  Delete reference to <lpMemPTD->aplInteger> as we no longer use it.
  Merge adjacent immediate numeric tokens into a single numeric
    strand token.
  Handle Boolean result from <ParsePointNotation>.


Directory trunk\MediaWiki\extensions:

APL.CSS:
