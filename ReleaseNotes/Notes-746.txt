Build #746 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Windows API FUnction Doesn't Signal Visible Page Fault

Directory trunk:

SAVEFCN.C:
SC_COPY.C:
  Replace <lstrcpyW> with own function as W's doesn't signal a
    Visible Page Fault so the <VirtualAlloc> code doesn't get called
    to back up a page with RAM.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Replace <lstrcpyW> with own function as W's doesn't signal a
    Visible Page Fault so the <VirtualAlloc> code doesn't get called
    to back up a page with RAM.
  Improve comments.
  Fix Bug:  In <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM>, mark :nnn entry as having a
    value so it can be tested in <LoadWorkspace_EM> and not reloaded
    unnecessarily.
