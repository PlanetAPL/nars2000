Version 0.0.1.8 consists of the following Builds:


Build #350 -- Version 0.0.1.8
-----------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Use global var for function-related debug display
    so it can be toggled easily.
  Change from <DbgMsgW2> to <DbgMsgW> and use a global var
    to control display of various debug displays.
  Fix Bug:  In <DisplayFcnSub>, handle user-defined function/operators.

EDITFCN.C:
  Write out the function name in the Function Editor title bar.
  Use #define to toggle use of clipping region in output.
  Use <lstrcpyW> instead of <CopyMemory> as we're copying the
    trailing zero, too.
  In <WM_PAINT>, move code around to optimize it.

EXECFNS.C:
  In DEBUG mode, avoid <YYResIsEmpty> complaints by incrememting
    the SI level around calls to <ExecFuncStr_EM_YY> and
    <ExecTrain_EM_YY>.
  Fix Bug:  In <ExecFuncStr_EM_YY>/<TKT_FCNNAMED>, handle
    user-defined function/operators.

EXTERNS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Change Function Editor title string to be a format string.

FREE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  In <FreeResultGlobalFcn>, handle freeing a user-defined
    function/operator within a function array.

PF_DTACK.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Format and comment call to <GetNextValueGlb>.

PF_RSHOE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Format and comment call to <GetNextValueGlb>.
  Avoid setting ptr type bits for result of <GetNextValueGlb> as they
    are already set.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnDydRightShoeGlbGlb_EM_YY>, clear the ptr type
    bits from the result of <GetNextValueGlb>.

PF_SQUAD.C:
  Format and comment call to <GetNextValueGlb>.

PF_UTACK.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Format and comment call to <GetNextValueGlb>.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Remove <bTrain> bit as it's no longer used.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Remove <bTrain> bit as it's no longer used.
  Fix Bug:  In <LeftOper:  (Train)> rule, force call to
    <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY> so as to have one function
    per element -- this way, we can easily count the #
    elements.
  Fix Bug:  In <Train:  LeftOper LeftOper> and
    <Train:  Train Leftoper>, set the strand base as
    appropriate.
  Fix typos in comments.

PO_DOT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Format and comment call to <GetNextValueGlb>.
  Avoid setting ptr type bits for result of <GetNextValueGlb> as they
    are already set.

QF_NC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  In <CalcNameClass>, handle Trains.

STRAND.C:
  In <StripStrand>, include debug assertions.
  Fix Bug:  In <FreeStrand>, avoid freeing Indirect entries -- they'll
    be freed when they occur directly.
  In <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>, reorganize code and use incoming
    <NAMETYPE_xxx> to distinguish Trains.


Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  In <EDIT_WM_Paint>, include DEBUG statements.
