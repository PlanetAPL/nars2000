--------------------------------

* Handle Decimal/Exponentiation Form In Denominator Of Rational Point Notation

Directory trunk:

CR_PROC.C:
  Fix bug in FSA which mistakenly allows a '/' or 'x' after a negative sign.
  Handle decimal/exponential form in denominator of rational point notation.

MACROS.H:
  Define macro to detect -0 as a FLT.

MPIFNS.C:
MPIFNS.H:
  Use <mpfr_strtofr> instead of <mpfr_set_str> when the string isn't zero-terminated.

PN_PARSE.H:
PN_PARSE.Y:
  Define and set flags to deal with rational numbers in strings.

PN_PROC.C:
  Use <mpfr_strtofr> instead of <mpfr_set_str> when the string isn't zero-terminated.
  In <PN_NumCalc>, set FLT flag as appropriate.
  In <PN_NumCalc>, call <mpq_init_set_str2> to convert string to a rational number and
    deal with the return code.
  In <PN_VectorAcc> and <PN_VectorRes>, set and test flags to deal with rational numbers in strings.
