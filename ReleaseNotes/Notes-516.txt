Build #516-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Allow Monadic and Dyadic Grade Up/down on Scalars and
  Monadic Grade Up/down on Characters

Directory trunk:

PF_DELTASTILE.C:
  Allow grade up/down of scalar returning {enclose}{zilde}.
  Allow grade up/down of character array using []AV as a default
    collating sequence.
  Fix Bug:  Monadic Grade up/down marked the result as a PV only
    if the right arg is a PV -- it should always be a PV.
  Use names for column indices into <FastBoolTrans>.
  Fix Bug:  Dyadic grade up/down did not mark the result as a PV.
