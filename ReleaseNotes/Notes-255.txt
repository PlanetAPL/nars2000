Directory trunk:

EXCEPT.C:
  Improve comments.
  Switch on actual exception code rather than calling MyGetExceptionCode in case hGlbPTD is invalid.

MAIN.H:
  Define new window message to display error message from )LOAD fail.

PERTAB.H:
  Rename PTD TabIndex as there's now a previous value, too.
  Define save area for previous tab index in case of )LOAD fail.

SAVEFCN.C:
  In the <SF_NumLinesXX> functions, emphasize that we subtract 1 from the rsult so as not to include the function header.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Rename PTD TabIndex as there's now a previous value, too.
  Move lock/unlock of PTD to a narrower focus.
  For WS NOT FOUND, display the error message in the caller's SM window.

SESSMAN.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <ReplaceLine>, change the incoming arg from hWndSM to hWndEC as we use the former only to get the latter.
  In <SMWndProc> WM_CREATE failure, use common label which reverses the Edit Control subclassing.
  Define new window message to display error message from )LOAD fail.
  In <SMWndProc> WM_DESTROY, move the GlobalFree of hGlbPTD to the end of <CreatenewTabInThread>.

TABCTRL.C:
  Initialize <iCurTab> in case we bail out early.
  Change initialization of <bRet> to FALSE so we can rely on it in case we bail out early.
  Save the previous tab index in case we fail on )LOAD.
  At end of <CreateNewTabInThread>,
    unlock <hGlbPTD>,
    delete the outgoing tab,
    unhook <LclEditCtrlWndProc>,
    show the incoming windows, and
    set the focus to the incoming SM.
  In TCM_DELETEITEM,
    ensure lpSymTab is valid before accessing it,
    ensure hWndSM is valid before using it,
    move DB, SM, and MC window destroy to <CreateNewTabInThread>,
  Rename PTD TabIndex as there's now a previous value, too.
