* Fix Bug:  Handle Replace Mode Text Caret For All Point Sizes

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  When creating the bitmap used for the Replace Mode text caret,
    handle the case where the average char width for the SM font
    is greater than 15 in which case we need to use multiple words
    in the bitmap for each row of the caret width.
