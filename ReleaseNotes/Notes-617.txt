Build #617 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Prompt Displays Before Error Message in Execute Primitive

Directory trunk:

ERRMSG.C:
  Display function name and line # in error message along with
    as many execute symbols as there are nested executes.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Call <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse> instead of <ImmExecStmt> when
    executing []ALX or []ELX so as not to introduce a spurious
    immediate execution mode SIS level.

MAIN.C:
  Use unique debugging numbers on calls to <DisplayPrompt> so we can
    tell them apart when debugging.

MAIN.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new EXITTYPE_xxx so as to distinguish between executing []ALX
    or []ELX vs. other executes.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  If we just returned from executing []ALX/[]ELX, don't display the
    prompt as we haven't displayed the result as yet.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Call <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse> instead of <ImmExecStmt> when
    executing []ALX or []ELX so as not to introduce a spurious
    immediate execution mode SIS level.
  Pass on as the exit type whether or not we just returned from
    executing []ALX or []ELX so the caller can avoid an untimely
    display of the prompt.

SC_IN.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
  Call <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse> instead of <ImmExecStmt> when
    executing data or function assignments so as not to introduce
    a spurious immediate execution mode SIS level.
