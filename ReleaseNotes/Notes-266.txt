Release #266, Version #0.0.0.17507
----------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DATATYPE.H:
  Label BPE_VEC and set APA value to 64 as we need it in []DR.

DISPDBG.C
  Handle immediate named vars.

MAIN.C:
  Set rounding precision to 64 instead of 53 as we need that for 64-bit integers.

PARSE.Y:
  Protect rule <CONSTANT ':'> from LookAhead.
  Save ptrs so we can unlock <hGlbPTD> early.
  Signal SYNTAX ERROR if not converting.

PF_COLONBAR.:
  Fix bug in reciprocal, where negative infinity right arg returned negative zero.
    Instead, check for infinite right arg and return 0.

PF_DOMINO.C:
  Fix bug where {domino} scalar returned a one-element vector.  Now it returns a scalar.

PO_CMIDDOT.C:
PO_DICIRCLE.C:
PO_DIERESIS.C:
PO_DIJOT.C:
PO_DITILDE.C:
PO_DOT.C:
PO_JOT.C:
PO_JOTDOT.C:
PO_SLASH.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Ensure that the left operand is a function.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Move <BytesIn> from <QF_DR.C> to here.
  In <iadd64>, set rounding precision to 64 bits as we need it for 64-bit integers.
  In <imul64>, set rounding precision to 64 bits as we need it for 64-bit integers.
  In both functions, clean up the code to check for overflow and if <lpbRet> is defined,
    always assign a result to it (TRUE or FALSE).
  In <imul64> define but comment out an alternate routine to check for overflow.

QF_DR.C:
  Allow conversion from/to APA.
  Move <BytesIn> from here to <PRIMFNS.C>.
  Use <BytesIn> to calculate bytes to move by <CopyMemory>.

SC_DROP.C:
SC_LIB.C:
SC_SAVE.C:
SC_WSID.C:
  Zap trailing blanks in the argument.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Zap trailing blanks in the argument.
  Zap LoadWsGlbVarXXX in PERTAB after use.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Delete obsolete comments.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  Use <BytesIn> to calculate bytes to move by <CopyMemory>.

UNITRANS.H:
  Clean up the table by using <NA> instead of <0x0000>.
