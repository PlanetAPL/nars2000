Version 0.0.2.21 consists of the following Builds:


Build #796 -- Version 0.0.2.21
------------------------------

* Allow More Syntax Constructions
* Coalesce Several Semantic Actions Into A Few

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Allow more syntax constructions such as LeftMonOper:Drv3Func AmbOpX,
    LeftOper:Drv3Func DydOp RightOper, Train:LeftOper Drv1Func,
    Train:LeftOper Drv6Func, etc.
  In <CheckNullOp3>, simplify the code.


Build #795 -- Version 0.0.2.21
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Quad Input Not Handled Correctly

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, handle an exit type of DISPLAY
    the same as NODISPLAY so as to catch Quad Input the same.


Build #794 -- Version 0.0.2.21
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Reference Count Is Off

Directory trunk:

FREE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Ensure <FreeResNNU> tests for a named function/operator.
  When freeing a fcn/opr/var, set the value to <PTR_REUSED> so we
    can test for it later.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Update copyright year.
  Move the call to <YYFreeArray> out of <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY> into
    the actions in <pl_parse.y> as calling in <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>
    is too soon.

STRAND.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Move the call to <YYFreeArray> out of <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY> into
    the actions in <pl_parse.y> as calling in <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>
    is too soon.

YYFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <YYCopyFcn>, if we encounter a function array that's been
    YYCopyArray'ed run it through <YYFreeArray>.
  In <YYFreeArray>, if the global memory handle is <PTR_REUSED>,
    ignore it.
  In <YYFreeGlbFcn>, do not ignore the contents of Trains when
    recursing.
