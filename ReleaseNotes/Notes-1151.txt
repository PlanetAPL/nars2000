Build #1151 -- Version 0.4.3.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bugs When Reallocating Symbol Table
* Fix Bug  When Reallocating A Token Stream

Directory trunk:

SAVEFCN.C:
  Avoid clobbering an existing error message having detected an error during Tokenize.
  Warn instead of failing function fix because of duplicate labels.

SC_IN.C:
  Avoid extra displays during )IN because of NoDisplay execute results.
  Correct origin of function line # in error message.

SYMTAB.C:
  Rename variable from *Size to *Nelm as it actually measures the latter rather than the former.
  Change VirtualAllocs from MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE to MEM_COMMIT only.
  In <SymTabResize>, handle global table resize.
  Include commented out debugging code for future use.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <AppendNewToken_EM>, if the reallocate fails on a token stream, try with a new allocate and copy old memory values to the new location.
