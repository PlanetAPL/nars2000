* Reduce Screen Flicker

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  Define <USEMEMDC_WM_PAINT> to double buffer in WM_PAINT.
  In <DBWndProc/WM_DRAWITEM>, do not double buffer if
    <USEMEMDC_WM_PAINT> is defined.
  In <LclListboxWndProc/WM_PAINT>, double buffer the DC
    unles there is an incoming DC or no update rectangle.

EDITFCN.C:
  In <LclECPaintHook> if we're Syntax Coloring, use the
    incoming DC instead of a new one as we're now double
    buffering.
  In <LclEditCtrlWndProc/WM_PAINT>, ensure that the left edge
    of the line is included in the update region in case
    Syntax Coloring has to change the color of a previous
    char not in the original update region.

Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Uncomment lines with TRACE(), FIXME() and WARN() macros
    so as to minimize the difference with the original file.
    These macros don't generate any code, so tehre's no
    harm in including them.
  In <EDIT_WM_Paint>, double buffer the output so as to
    reduce screen flicker.
  In <EDIT_WM_Size>, don't double buffer as we now do it
    in <WM_PAINT>.
