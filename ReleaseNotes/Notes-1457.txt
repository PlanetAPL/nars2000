Build #1457 -- Version 0.4.13.xx
--------------------------------

* Name Assignment of A Niladic AFO Is Saved As A Niladic AFO, Not Evaluated To A Variable
* Fix Bug In Syntax Analyzer When Unwinding Left And Right Stacks

Directory trunk:

MAKEFILE.INC:
  When producing a prototype file, don't bother to display the filename.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedNAM_SPNF>, if the function is an AFO, assign it as a NF rather than evaluate it as a var.
  After <PARSELINE_ERROR:> when unwinding the left and right stacks, do not free <soEOS> and <soSOS> tokens.
