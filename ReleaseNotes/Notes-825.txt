* Save Tokenized Lines At End Of UDFO Header

Directory trunk:

APLERRORS.H:
  Update copyright year.

CS_PROC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <CS_ChangeTokenType>, <CS_ChainTokens>, <CS_SetTokenCLIndex>,
    and <CS_SELECT_Stmt_EM> use offset to tokenized line to find it.
  Pass ptr to token header to <PrimFnMonUpTackJotPLParse> instead of
    global memory handle.
  In <CS_GetToken_COM>, return offset from UDFO header to tokenized line
    instead of global memory handle.

DISPDBG.C:
  In <DisplayTokens>, pass ptr to token header instead of global
    memory handle.

    <TKT_CONTINUEIF> and <TKT_LEAVEIF>.

EDITFCN.C:
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <Untokenize> instead of global
    memory handle.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, use offset to tokenized line to find it.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <ParseLine> instead of global
    memory handle.

EXECMFN.C:
  Size the tokenized lines beforehand so we know how much to allocate
    for the UDFO header.

FH_PARSE.H:
  In <tagFCNLINE> replace the glolbal memory handle for the tokenized line
    header with an offset from the start of the UDFO.
  In <tagDFN_HEADER>, include offset to start of tokenized lines.
  In <tagFHLOCALVARS>, replace <UNION_TOKEN> with ptr to tokenized line header.

FH_PARSE.Y:
  Update copyright year.
  Replace references to <t2> with a ptr to the tokenized line header.

FREE.C:
  Replace references to the tokenized line global memory handle with
    the offset to the tokenized line header.

GETFNS.C:
  Delete function <GetTokenLineHandle> as we no longer need it.

GOTO.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Replace references to the tokenized line global memory handle with
    the offset to the tokenized line header.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <ParseLine> instead of global
    memory handle.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <Untokenize> instead of global
    memory handle.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Pass ptr to token header to <PrimFnMonUpTackJotPLParse> instead of
    global memory handle.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <Untokenize> instead of global
    memory handle.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <ParseLine> instead of global
    memory handle.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  In <tagPLLOCALVARS>, replace <UNION_TOKEN> with ptr to tokenized line header.
  In <tagPLLOCALVARS> replace the glolbal memory handle for the tokenized line
    header with a ptr to the tokenized line header.

PL_PARSE.PROTO:
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <ParseLine> instead of global
    memory handle.
  Define prototypes for additional functions.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <ParseLine> instead of global
    memory handle.
  In <DisplayTokens>, pass ptr to token header instead of global
    memory handle.
  Replace references to <t2> with a ptr to the tokenized line header.

QF_AT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <CalcSymEntrySize>, replace call to <MyGlobalSize> with calculation
    of the size as we no longer have a global memory handle.

SAVEFCN.C:
  In <SaveFunctionCom>, use generic error message rather than format string.
  Size the tokenized lines beforehand so we know how much to allocate
    for the UDFO header.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <Untokenize> instead of global
    memory handle.
  Define new function to size/save a UDFO tokenized line.
  In <GetSpecialLabelNums>, use offset to tokenized line to find it.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include additional function names.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Remove <UTLockAndSet> as it's replaced by one line now.
  Replace references to <t2> with a ptr to the tokenized line header.
  Pass ptr to tokenized line header to <Untokenize> instead of global
    memory handle.
  In <AppendNewCSToken_EM>, use addtional coalescing to reduce the size
    of the CS stack.

TOKENIZE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Replace references to <t2> with a ptr to the tokenized line header.

TOKENS.H:
  In <tagTOKEN_TYPES>, define zero entry and eliminate <TKT_FIRST>,
    <TKT_LENGTHp1>, and <TKT_LENGTH>.
  In <tagTOKEN_TYPES>, define new token <TKT_ENS> for CS stack coalescing.
