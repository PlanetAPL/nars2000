Build #691 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle File | Save As... Correctly

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Define new message to display the prompt.

MAIN.C:
  Fix Bug:  When selecting File | Save As... from the main
    menu, do not require that the workspace name already exist.
  Fix Bug:  Handle Save As in the SWITCH stmt which follows the
    call to <GetOpenFileName>.
  Fix Bug:  After calling one of the File | ... menu items, call
    common code to display the prompt.
  Move code to display the prompt from IDM_SAVE_WS to MYWM_PROMPT.
  Fix Bug:  In <OFNHookProc>, save the message ID during <WM_INITDIALOG>
    and wait until <WM_NOTIFY/CDN_INITDONE> to set the Open button text.
