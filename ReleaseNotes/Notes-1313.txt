Build #1313 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellanous DEBUG Changes

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  In <DisplayHeap>, include the random state's seed as a value not to be displayed.

QF_DR.C:
  In <SysFnDR_Show_EM_YY>, shorten the displayed name for VFP vars so it doesn't wrap on small screens.

RESDEBUG.C:
  In <_MyHeapAlloc>, don't put DEBUG_HEAP into effect unless DEBUG is also.
