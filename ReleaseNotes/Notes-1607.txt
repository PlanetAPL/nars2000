Build #1607 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Changes And Bug Fixes

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Fix DEBUG bug by handling certain cases of <MyGlobalLockTxt>.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Pass <lpSymGlb[Lft|Rht]> to subfunctions instead of NULL as we need it in the case of Global Numerics.
  In certain cases when the result is NESTED, but the calculation is numeric, we make the mistake of saving a
    pseudo result on top of the actual result.
  In <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM> when the result is NESTED, but the calculation is Global Numeric, we save the Global Numeric result
    in the Nested array causing a crash.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <TypeDemote>, we increment <lpMemRht> but fail to restore it to the beginning and re-use that ptr as if it were at the start.
