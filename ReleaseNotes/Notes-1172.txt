Build #1172 -- Version 0.4.4.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Variant Operator With []PP And Left Operand Of Format Primitive

Directory trunk:

GETFNS.C:
  Rename <SetQuadPP> to <SetQuadPPV> as it is used for VFPs.
  In <SetQuadPPV> limit the value to <DEF_MAX_QUADPPVFP> as this function is used to restore []PP for VFPs.

PO_VARIANT.C:
  When reading/restoring []PP, use the VFP functions instead of the ones for 64-bit doubles.
