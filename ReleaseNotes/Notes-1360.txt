Build #1360 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In .ZIP File Not Including Correct Crash Reporting Files

Directory trunk:

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Change makefile to include the <sendrpt.exe> file in the .zip.
  Remove definitions of <CS_LIB> as it's not used.

MAIN.C:
  Change text on missing <crashrpt.dll> to indicate that one of its missing dependencies might be the cause of the error.

These files were mistakenly included in the previous build.
