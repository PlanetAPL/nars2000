--------------------------------

* Implement Temporary APVs To Handle Elided Indices

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  In <AllocateGlobalArray>, allow the dimension ptr to be NULL as that how Temporary APVs are initialized.

EXTERNS.H:
  Re-format and comment constant tokens <tkZero> and <tkBlank>.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Simplify and coalesce cases of integer conversion by calling <ConvertToInteger_SCT>.
  Fix bug where the result of indexing may be marked as PV0 or PV1 incorrectly.
  Implement temporary APVs to handle elided indices.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more entry points.

STRAND.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  Implement temporary APVs to handle elided indices.

TOKENS.H:
