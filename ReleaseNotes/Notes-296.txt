Build #296 -- Version 0.0.0.18946
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  Rename <DisplayGlbArr> to <DisplayGlbArr_EM> to reflect the return value.
  Move error message calls to common labels.

EDITFCN.C:
  Improve comments.

EXCEPT.C:
  In <CheckPTDVirtStr>, round down to page boundary the invalid address so as
    to avoid overallocating in case the increment size is > a page.
  Replace <RaiseException> with <MySetExceptionCode> and execute the handler as
    the former pops up one level and the latter executes the current handler.
  In CheckMemVirtStr>, check for guard page access.
  In <DisplayException>, display the guard page address.

EXECDFN.C:
IMMEXEC.C:
PARSE.Y:
PF_UTACKJOT.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
SESSMAN.C:
THREADS.H:
  Pass <bActOnErrors> flag to <ParseLine> and <ImmExecStmt>.

EXTERNS.H:
  Increase the default sizes for numbers and strings.
  Define _alphabet_ in symbol names.

PERTAB.H:
  Save error line # in case we need it when calling []FX from )IN.

PF_DTACK.C:
  Fix bug:  Dyadic down tack (Encode/Representation) fails with scalar left arg.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  In <PrimFnMonDownTackJot_EM_YY>, surround calls to <CompileArrXXXX> with __try/__except
    so as to catch LIMIT ERRORs.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Fix bug:  Used the wrong index for result of dyadic reduction when the items of the
    result are arrays.

QF_FX.C:
  Save error line # (origin-0) in PTD struc in case we need it when calling []FX from )IN.
  Fix bug:  []FX on vector of character vectors crashes.

QF_UCS.C:
  Handle values between in [2*16, 2*31) with a replacement char (UTF-16).
  Move error message calls to common labels.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Fix bug:  In <SF_ReadLineN>, don't copy extra WCHAR as the caller has already takne care
    to allocate and zero it.  This fixes a bug in []FX on vector of character vectors.

SC_COMMON.C:
  Define common routine <ShortenWSID> to shorten WSIDs with default leading drive/dir.

SC_IN.C:
  Finish )IN.

SC_SAVE.C:
SC_WSID.C:
  Display shortened WSID if default leading drive/dir.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more addresses for debugging purposes.

SYSVARS.C:
  Define []AF as synonym for []UCS.
  Simplify macro calls.
  Fix bug:  In <ValidSetPR_EM>, when demoting a one-element vector to a scalar, the code
    moves a pointer before it should.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Fix bug:  In <CheckResizeStr_EM>, the reallocate fails to take into consideration the
    unit size (APLCHAR) of the allocation.  The same change is made to <CheckResizeNum_EM>,
    but there the unit size is (char) so there's no problem.  This bug shows itself when
    tokenizing a long string.
  Implement {lamp} as a closing comment marker thus allowing within line comments such as
    code {lamp} Any comment {lamp} more code.
  Remove <NORMAL_EXIT> code and reference as it's no longer used.

UNICODE.H:
  Define replacement char for UTF-16 values outside UCS-2.
  Improve comments.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Note that we use UCS-2, not UTF-16.
