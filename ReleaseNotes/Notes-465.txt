Build #465 -- Version 0.0.1.16
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Mark all IisFvF cases as "No such primitive".
  Fix Bug:  Several cases of simple vs. simple were misstated in that
    the wrong type parameter (left instead of right) was used.
  Fix Bug:  Several cases with a Boolean result didn't handle equal/not-equal
    between numeric and char.
  Fix Bug:  Several cases of simple arrays w/axis operator were still guarded
    by a DbgBrk stmt in which case the system crashed.
