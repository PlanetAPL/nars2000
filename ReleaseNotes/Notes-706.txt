Build #706 -- Version 0.0.2.16
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Avoid Display Of Functions In )IN

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  Pass Edit Ctrl window handle to <ExecSysCmd> so it can set the
    cursor to it new value (running).

PF_DOMINO.C:
  Improve comments.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <ArrExprCheckCaller>, save the result for later display unless
    the expression starts with a "sink" (i.e., display off).  This
    stops )IN from displaying the function names it creates.

SC_IN.C:
  Allow result of NOVALUE from <PrinFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse> as that's
    what the above change in <pl_parse.y> implies.

SYSCMDS.C:
  Pass Edit Ctrl window handle to <ExecSysCmd> so it can set the
    cursor to it new value (running).
  In <ExecSysCmd>, set the new cursor and update the window so any
    pending output displays.
