Build #293 -- Version 0.0.0.18678
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

COMPRO.H:
  Include prototypes for new module.

DISPLAY.C:
  Widen string passed to <CheckVirtAlloc>.

EXCEPT.C:
  Widen string passed to <CheckVirtAlloc>.
  Collect common code into <CheckPTDVirtStr> for multiple uses.  This
    might actually fix a nasty bug which causes )SAVE to crash leaving
    a vanishing short trail for debugging.
  Format and display CR2 in Crash Control window.

EXTERNS.H:
  Correct []IC documentation on L * _ that it applies to L<=-1 not L<-1.

INIFILE.C:
  Implement OptionFlags.bBackupOnLoad & OptionFlags.bBackupOnSave and
    read and write these flags from/to <nars2000.ini>.

MAIN.H:
  Move workspace #defines to <workspace.h>.

MAKEFILE.W32:
MAKEFILE.W64:
  Define new action DELPRO to delete all .pro files.
  Include new module (SC_COMMON.C).

PARSE.Y:
  Widen string passed to <CheckVirtAlloc>.
  Fix bug where <LookaheadDyadicOp> fails when it encounters a
    TKT_FCNNAMED token (such as a system function).

PF_QUERY.C:
  Fix bug where monadic query on a float returns a float; instead it
    should return an int.  This fix involves defining the routine IisF
    instead of FisF, and changing the monadic storage result to INT
    from FLOAT.  To ease maintenance, the IisF routine calls the IisI
    routine to generate the actual result.  Ultimately, I'd like to
    change the modulus from the prime (2*31)-1 to the prime (2*61)-1
    but I need to find a "good" primitive root.

PF_STAR.C:
  Check for special case of (|1) * R instead of just 1 * R so it doesn't
    blow up to FLOAT.
  Fix bug where L * _ for L < -1 was subject to []IC.  The correct
    range is L <= -1.

SC_COMMON.C:
  New module which collects various common routines in the LOAD/SAVE/COPY
    group.
  Define a new routine <MakeWorkspaceBackup> which makes a backup of a
    workspace file into a file named either filename.load.bak.ws.nars
    or filename.save.bak.ws.nars, subject to OptionFlags.  These files
    are generated on every load and/or save so that if that operation
    goes awry, you have a backup minus your work after the last save.
    As the old timers may recall, "Thunderstorms in Bethesda, )SAVE often".

SC_DROP.C:
  Include "workspace.h" explicitly because we moved some equates from <main.h>
    into <workspace.h>.

SC_FNOV.C:
  Display global names only.
  Fix bug where an extra line is inserted into the output causing double-spacing.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Move #defines to common <workspace.h> file.
  Make a backup of the workspace before every )LOAD command, if requested.
  Widen string passed to <CheckVirtAlloc>.
  Move routines to common module <sc_common.c>.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Move routines to common module <sc_common.c>.
  Make a backup of the workspace before every )SAVE command, if requested.
  Collect tail end of )SAVE processing to a separate routine which can
    be called from the (new) exception handler around )SAVE.  This gives
    us a better chance of having a less corrupt workspace in case the
    )SAVE goes awry.

WORKSPACE.H:
  Move #defines to common <workspace.h> file.
