* Fix Bug:  Avoid Duplicate Counting When Copying A Function Array

Directory trunk:

STRAND.C:
  In <YYCopyFcn>, remove TopLvl flag as it's no longer needed.

YYFNS.C:
  Split <YYCountFcnStr> into two parts <YYCountFcnStr/YYCountFcnGlb>
    so as to avoid duplicate counting by diving into global memory
    handles without looking at the outer token count as it isn't
    relevant.
