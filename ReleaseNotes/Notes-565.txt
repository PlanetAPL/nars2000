Build #565 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Paint Lines In DEBUG Window In Contrasting Color If RefCnt > 1

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  Define foreground and background colors for RefCnt > 1 lines.
  Mark the Listbox in the DEBUG window as owner drawn and with strings.
  Define actions for <WM_MEASUREITEM> and <WM_DRAWITEM> in response to
    the owner drawn Listbox, avoiding screen flicker by drawing into a
    memory DC.
  In <DBWndProc/MYWM_DBGMSGW>, transfer any leading <UTF16_REFCNT_GT1>
    character to the beginning of the string saved in the Listbox so
    it can be tested for easily in the <WM_DRAWITEM> code.
  In <LclListboxWndProc> define new message handler for <WM_ERASEBKGND>
    to reduce screen flicker.

DEFINES.H:
  Define character and string which marks the RefCnt >1 lines.

DISPDBG.C:
  For DEBUG window displays that show a RefCnt and that RefCnt is > 1,
    prefix the line with a special character to indicate that fact so
    the line may be displayed in a contrasting color.
