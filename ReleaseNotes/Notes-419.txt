Build #419 -- Version 0.0.1.14
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <CreateFcnWindow>, when about to create a Function Editor window,
    first check to see if the same function name is open for editing;
    if it is, switch to that window instead of opening a new one.
  In <FEWndProc>/<WM_CREATE>, at the very end, link the new window handle
    into the doubly-linked chain of FE window handles.
  In <FEWndProc>/<MYWM_CMPNAME>, compare the incoming function name
    against this window's function name.
  In <FEWndProc>/<WM_DESTROY>, unlink this window handle from the
    doubly-linked chain of FE window handles.
  Define new routine <GetFunctionName> extracted from and now called
    by <SetFETitle> to fill in the FE window's function name and return
    its length.

MAIN.H:
  Define two new extra byte offsets for FE window class to hold the
    forward abd backward window handles in the doubly-linked chain.
  Define a new window message to allow the caller to ask the FE window
    to compare a given function name with that window's function name.

PERTAB.H:
  Define a new struct member to hold the FE windows doubly-linked list
    anchor.
