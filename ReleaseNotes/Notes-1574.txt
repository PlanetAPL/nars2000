* Fix Bug When Editing A Logical Line In A Function Header

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <LftMarginsFE>, omit the small indent of 2 as we no longer need it

  In <GetFunctionName?, handle the case where the function name continues to the next physical line.
  In <RespecifyNewQuadPW>, fix bug calculating the new width by taking into account the left margin in the SM.

  In <CopyBlockLines>, return the number of chars copied.
  Improve comments.

SAVEFCN.C:

SESSMAN.C:

  In <SetMarginsSM>, use the new function.
  Improve comments.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <IsLocalName>, use the result of <CopyBlockLines> as opposed to calling a separate function.
