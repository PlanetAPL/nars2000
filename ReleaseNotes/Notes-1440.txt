Build #1440 -- Version 0.4.12.xx
--------------------------------

* Implement []FEATURE[2] As "Allow -0"
* Include "Hdr" In Name Of Result Of <MyGlobalLock>

DEFINES.H:
  Remove "Allow -0" from "User Preferences" and into []FEATURE[2].
  Remove old debugging aid DBGENTER/DBGLEAVE.

EXTERNS.H:
  Remove "Allow -0" from "User Preferences" and into []FEATURE[2].

INIFILE.C:
  Don't pass "xxx_CWS_BR" var to "GetPrivateProfileXXX" functions as we need its
    length to be one-to-one with the default value.
  Improve comments.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock> and elsewhere.
  In <GetPrivateProfileGlbComW>, ensure resutl length of sysvar is at least minimum required,
    and if not, fill in trailing values from the default.

MACROS.H:
  Define and use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.

MAKEFILE.INC
  Omit Whole Program Optimization as that slows down each compile.

MPIFNS.C:
PF_COLONBAR.C:
PN_PARSE.Y:
TRANSLATE.C:
TYPEMOTE.C:
  Use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.

PF_BAR.C:
  Use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock> and elsewhere.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Fix bug in <ArrayIndexSetSingLst_EM> where indexed assignment into sysvar uses the wrong index.

PF_STILE.C:
  Use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.
  Use exact arithmetic on rational residue.

PF_TIMES.C:
  Use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock> and elsewhere.

PN_PROC.C:
  Use names for current value of <bAllowNeg0>.
  Fix bug in <PN_VectorAcc> when determining if a number is expressible as an integer or a rational.
  In <PN_VectorRes>, terminate the string before calling <ParsePointNotation> and restore afterwards.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnPointDone>, terminate the string before calling <ParsePointNotation> and restore afterwards.
