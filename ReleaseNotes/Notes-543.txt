Build #543 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Change The Binding Strength of Left Brackets and Its Lefthand Token

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.PROTO:
  Change the return of <AmbOpSwap> from <BOOL> to <UBOOL> so we
    always use unsigned BOOLs.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Introduce a new rule to handle A[B] as a separate token within a
    strand so it has a higher binding strength than strands, moving
    to this rule the corresponding actions from <StrandInst>.  This
    moves us closer to APL2's binding strength rules, although
    1 2 3[1] still works -- APL2 requires parens as in (1 2 3)[1].

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <TokenTypeFV>, mark <TKT_STRAND> as a Var.
