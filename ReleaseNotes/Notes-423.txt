Build #423 -- Version 0.0.1.15

Directory trunk:

QF_NC.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <CalcNameClass>, the test for Magic Functions is no longer
    on <NAMETYPE_UNK> as they are now in the symbol table.  Instead test
    for them in the function and operator name types.  This affects the
    result of []NC and []NL.  Note that there is no separate name class
    for Magic Functions vs. Magic Operators (such as #DydRank).
