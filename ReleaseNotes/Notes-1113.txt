* Change Definition Of Rank Operator

Directory trunk:

PO_DIJOT.C:
  This operator was originally based upon code found in the paper by J. Philip Benkhard,
    "Extending structure, type, and expression in APL2", ACM SIGAPL APL Quote Quad,
    v.21 n.4, p.20-38, Aug. 1991, but later was modified to reflect the
    definition of the Rank operator in the ISO-IEC 13751 Extended APL Standard.
