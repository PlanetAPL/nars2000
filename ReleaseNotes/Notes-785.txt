------------------------------

* Use Themes For Display Of Ownerdrawn Buttons In Customize Dialog

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Use Themes to display the keycap buttons.
  Improve comments.
  Remove code to remove the highlight on a keycap button as we now
    use OwnerDraw to paint the buttons.
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.
  Delete the code to create, use, and destroy a special font for
    the Fonts buttons, which are no longer ownerdrawn.
  Provide Tooltips for the Keyboard Layout Combobox and special
    Keycaps.
  Draw the Keycap buttons ourselves in WM_DRAWITEM.  Previously,
    I used NMCUSTOMDRAW, but Wine doesn't support that so I changed.
  Handle <WM_THEMECHANGED>.
  If the user clicks on a special Keycap, beep and ignore.
  Allow BS in the Unicode Edit Ctrl.

DEFINES.H:
  Remove unused MYWM_xxx message.
  Define additional single- and wide-chars.

EDITFCN.C:
  Use equates instead of numbers.

EXTERNS.H:
  Remove font handle for the Font buttons as we no longer need it.
  Remove initial value from <uNumRecentFiles> as we no longer need it.

INIFILE.C:
  When reading in the # Recent Files from the .ini file, set the default
    to zero as it represents the # of files in the .ini file, which is zero
    at the start.
  When allocating glkobal memory for the Recent Files, use <DEF_RECENTFILES>
    as that's the maximum we keep track of.
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.

KEYBOARDS.H:
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.

MAIN.C:
  ToolTip => Tooltip.
  Move <MFWndProc/TCN_SELCHANGE:> code to new function so it may be called
    separately.
  In <MFWndProc/WM_CLOSE:>, if the Customize dialog is still open,
    check ask it to close and if the user doesn't want to, fail the return.
  Remove font handle for the Font buttons as we no longer need it.
  Define new function to handle <MFWndProc/TCN_SELCHANGE:>.

MAIN.RC:
  Change the Font buttons to use constant text and not be ownerdrawn.
  Change the Keyboards property page Keycap buttons to be ownerdrawn.

REBAR.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.
  Change from <_TrackMouseEvent> to <SetCapture/ReleaseCapture> as
    Wine doesn't handle the former well.
  Create separate Tooltip windows for the toolbars so we don't need to
    avoid leakage of parameters between the various uses.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc>, handle <WM_SETFONT>.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc>, handle <WM_LBUTTONUP>.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc/WM_DESTROY:>, destroy the Tooltip
    window instead of deleting the various tools.
  Define a new function to set the maximum tip width to depend upon the
    Tooltip font in use.

RESOURCE.H:
  Remove <xxx_BUTTON_TEXT> defines as they are no longer used.

SC_COMMON.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <SaveRecentWSID>, append new WSID to end of short list if room.

TABCTRL.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCM_DELETEITEM:>, call common routine to effect
    <TCN_SELCHANGE>.
