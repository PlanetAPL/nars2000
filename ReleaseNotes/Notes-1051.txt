Build #1051 -- Version 0.3.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In # Primes <= N

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  In <NumPrimes>, factor out the check for argument not a prime.
  In <NumPrimes>, when searching forwards, break on test for equality.
  In <NumPrimes>, at end add one to the result to account for the fact that the
    <NthPrimeTab> is in origin-0.
  In <PrimFnPiNumPrimes>, use <signum> on the result of <mpz_cmp> as it doesn't
    always return one of -1, 0, 1.

PRIMES.H:
  Revert back to the correct origin-0 values of the primes.  Duh!
