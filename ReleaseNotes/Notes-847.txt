Build #847 -- Version 0.0.2.23
------------------------------

* Handle Error In Point Notation At Execution Time, Not Tokenization Time

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnPointDone>, clear <pnLocalVars> at initialization so we can assume
    its initial state.
  In <fnPointDone>, if <ParsePointNotation> fails, treat as execution time
    error instead of at tokenization time.
  Improve comments.
