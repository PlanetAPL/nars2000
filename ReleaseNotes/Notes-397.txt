Build #397 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <LclEditCtrlWndProc>/<WM_SIZE>, invalidate the client area so the
    window is repainted.  We used to do this in the caller, but now it is
    done more centrally.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc>/<WM_SIZE> don't invalidate the Edit Ctrl window as that's
    done more centrally in the Edit Ctrl window proc.
