Build #275 -- Version 0.0.0.17717
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DFNHDR.Y:
  Include commented out defines for debugging.
  Delete extraneous VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree as the caller already does this.
  Include debugging statements in <fh_yylex>.
  Include debugging statement in <fh_yyfprintf>.

DISPLAY.C:
  Move <lpwszFormat> from global to PerTabData value.
  Return value from <DisplayGlbArr> to allow it to fail on (say) LIMIT ERROR.
  Pass ptr to function token to <DisplayGlbArr> so it can fail
    with an error message (ptr to function token needed for caret).
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.
  Move __except in <DisplayGlbArr> down to the bottom so it can catch Access
    Violations on <lpwszFormat>.
  In call to <CheckVirtAlloc>, delete ptr and length of <lclMemVirtStr>s
    as we now use the MVS chain.
  Improve initialization of <lpFmtHeader>.
  Improve comments.
  Check for Ctrl-Break inside of raw output loop to handle display of (say) []AV.
  Use <MyVirtualAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and
      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.

EDIT.RC:
  Define new file to hold comomon .rc statements.

EDITFCN.C:
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.

      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.

EXCEPT.C:
  Include text for LIMIT ERROR message.
  In call to <CheckVirtAlloc>, delete ptr and length of <lclMemVirtStr>s
    as we now use the MVS chain.
  Put common code into <CheckMemVirtStr> for multiple uses.
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.

EXECMFN.C:
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.

      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.

EXTERNS.H:
  Ensure DEF_xxx_INCR_SIZE is non-zero as a zero size is an error to <VirtualAlloc>
    when committing a range.
  Increase <DEF_WFORMAT_MAXSIZE> so []AV can display without a LIMIT ERROR.
  Increase <DEF_DISPLAY_MAXSIZE> so []AV can display without a LIMIT ERROR.
  Move <lpwszFormat> from global to PerTabData value.
  Move <[STRAND_VAR]> and <[STRANDFCN]> <VirtualAlloc>s from global to PerTabData.
  Include previous and next ptrs in <MEMVIRTSTR> to make a chain of structs.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Use <MyVirtualAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and
      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.
  For <VirtualAlloc>s that are of fixed size, use <MEM_TOP_DOWN> so they compact well.

MAIN.C:
  Include <wininet.h> as start of dialog for update checking.
  Define struc for passing args to <DialogBoxParam> for update checking.
  Call <CheckForUpdates> in response to a corresponding menu selection.
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.
  Include ptr to text in debug version of <MEMVIRTSTR> to ease debugging.
  Use <MyVirtualAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and
      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.

MAKEFILE:
  Include <wininet.lib> for Internet routines.

PARSE.Y:
  Include ptr to text in debug version of <MEMVIRTSTR> to ease debugging.
  Use <GuardAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and link the result into
    a chain of <lclMemVirtStr>s so it can be searched when an Access Violation occurs.
  In call to <CheckVirtAlloc>, delete ptr and length of <lclMemVirtStr>s
    as we now use the MVS chain.
  In <pl_yyfprintf>, move call to <va_end> up to same place as in <fh_yyfprintf>.

PERTAB.H:
  Improve comments.

  Move <lpwszFormat> from global to PerTabData value.
  Improve initialization of <lpFmtHeader>.

  Factor out common initialization of <*lpaplNELMRes> so teh <ARRAY_CHAR> case can use it.
  Fix bug where ''{rho} was disallowed.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Use <MyVirtualAlloc> instead of <VirtualAlloc> and
      <MyVirtualFree>  instead of <VirtualFree>  to catch errors more easily.
  For <VirtualAlloc>s that are of fixed size, use <MEM_TOP_DOWN> so they compact well.

RESDEBUG.C:
  Improve comments.
  Define <_MyVirtualAlloc> and <_MyVirtualFree> to catch errors more easily.
