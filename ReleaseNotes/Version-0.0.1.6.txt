Build #348 -- Version 0.0.1.6
-----------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <AssignName_EM>, define token type for when assigning a Train.

DISPDBG.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Align debug output.
  In <DisplayFcnGlb> and <DisplayFcnSub>, handle display of Trains.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, move <TKT_OP[1|2|3]NAMED> to bottom and explain.

EDITFCN.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <CreateFcnWindow>, handle Trains.
  In <SyntaxColor>, save string length in case we're selecting from
    the middle of a comment.
  In <WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK>, handle Trains and let through any name so
    we display an error message if the name isn't editable instead
    of ignoring the double click.

EXECFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <ExecFcnGlb_EM_YY>, handle Trains.
  Define new routine <ExecTrain_EM_YY> to handle Trains.

MACROS.H:
  In <IsNameTypeName>, handle Trains so )NMS displays them.

PF_LTACK.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Define behavior of monadic Left Tack as returning the right arg.

PF_RTACK.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Define behavior of monadic Right Tack as returning the right arg.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define bit in <PL_YYSTYPE> to indicate that this stack element is a Train.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define new token for Named Train.
  Fix Bug:  When assigning a function, monadic, dyadic, or ambiguous operator
    there is a memory leak because we didn't free a result.
  Rename <NAMETYPE_TRAIN> to <NAMETYPE_TRN>.
  Incldue <NAMETRN> in allowed names for assignment to a name.
  Fix Bug:  Define additional rule in <Drv1Func> to allow a <Drv1Func> on the
    left of a function strand.
  Allow <NAMETRN> as a <LeftOper>.
  Finish rules for Trains.
  Allow <NAMETRN> as a <RightOper>.
  In <SymbTypeVFO> and <pl_yylex>, use switch stmt to handle <NAMETYPE_xxx>s
    so as to trap new types, and handle Trains at the same time.

QF_EX.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <EraseableName>, allow Trains.

QF_TF.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <SysFnDydTF2_EM_YY>, handle Trains.

SC_OUT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <CmdOut_EM>, handle Trains.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <CmdSave_EM>, handle Trains.

STRAND.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix typo.
  Improve comments.
  In <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>, handle Trains.

SYMTAB.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define <NAMETYPE_TRN> for Trains.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <fnComDone>, use actual computed string length instead
    of <lstrlenW> value because the routine might be called in the middle
    of a comment in which case the allocated SyntaxColor buffer is of
    one length, and the string might be longer.
  In <Tokenize_EM>, save string length in case we're selecting from
    the middle of a comment.

TOKENIZE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define save area for actual string length.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <TranslateNameTypeToImmType>, handle Trains.

YYFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename <lpYYBase> to <lplpYYBase> as it's really a ptr to a ptr.
  Fix Bug:  In <IncrFcnMem>, handle the case where a function strand
    has a variable in it such as 1{jot}+.

Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Avoid compiling memory DC code if we're not using it.
