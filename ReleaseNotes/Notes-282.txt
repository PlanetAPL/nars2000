Build #282 -- Version 0.0.0.18282
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  Improve comments.

CONVERT.C:
DFNHDR.Y:
DISPDBG.C:
EXCEPT.C:
EXCEDFN.C:
FREE.C:
IMMEXEC.C:
MACROS.H:
MAIN.C:
PF_UTACKJOT.C:
PRIMFNS.C:
REFCNT.C:
RESDEBUG.C:
SESSMAN.C:
STRAND.C:
SYMTAB.C:
TOKENIZE.C:
TYPEMOTE.C:
EDITCTRL.C:
YYFNS.C:
  Prepare to support 64-bit compile.

INIFILE.C:
  Factor out initialization of <aplNELMRes>.
  Check the first element of <wszTemp> for zero instead of checking the
    result of <swscanf> as the latter changed from zero to -1 when I
    changed compilers (and libraries).  It's defined to return -1 if
    no more data, but the previous libraries didn't do that.

MAIN.DEF:
MAKEPRO.DEF:
MAKEVER.DEF:
  Remove DESCRIPTION as it's no longer supported by later compilers.

MAKEFILE:
  Append $(QDEBUG) directory to INCLUDE files.
  Factor out /c from each call to $(CC) into $(CFLAGS_WEXE).
  Define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to get rid of the nagging.
  Use $** instead of the named dependencies.
  In making <Makever> and <Makepro> use LIBCMT.LIB instead of LIBC.LIB as the
    later libraries don't have that one.

MAKEPRO.C:
  Fold <CheckVarArgFns> and <CheckAnachronism> into one function <DeleteText>.
  Define new text substitutions to handle glitches in /Zg generation in later
    compilers.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Use #define instead of duplicating a string for formatting date/time.

VER.H:
  Remove <ver.h> as it isn't used (and isn't present in later include directories).

WORKSPACE.H:
  Prepare to support 64-bit compile.
  Use #define instead of duplicating a string for formatting date/time.
