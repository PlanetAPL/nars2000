Build #917 -- Version 0.0.3.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Restore Tooltips For The Language Bar

Directory trunk:

REBAR.C:
  Update copyright year.
  A previous Build (#912) mistakenly changed a local var from static to normal after which
    that var was no longer properly initialized.  This had the effect of no longer displaying
    tooltips for the Language Bar.  Instead of restoring the static attribute, I chose to
    initialize the var when needed.
