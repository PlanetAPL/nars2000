Directory trunk:

COMPRO.H:
  Include <getreent> in the list of modules to compile.

DEBUG.C:
  Redefine <Assert> so it stops at the level of the assertion failure, rather than one level down.

EXCEPT.C:
  Call <exit> only if non-debug version.

MAIN.H:
  Redefine <Assert> so it stops at the level of the assertion failure, rather than one level down.

MAKEFILE:
  Include <getreent> in the list of modules to compile.
  Include <pf_circle> in dependency generation (how was this missed?)

PF_CIRCLE.C:
  No changes, but svn diagrees.

PF_QDOT.C:
  Define missing FisI routine (used for !toolarge)
  Use computed value for constant 20.
  Check for !toolarge and signal explicit error -- GSL calls fprintf???
  Check for toolarge in A!B and signal explicit error; otherwise it's PosInfinity.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Delete call to <DisplayException> if error can be handled.

STARTADDR.H:
  Delete <Assert> as it no longer exists.
  Include <__getreent> as we now manage <getreent.c>.
