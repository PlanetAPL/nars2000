* Avoid Reshaping Singleton Integer To An APA Unless Multi-element result

Directory trunk:

PF_RHO.C:
  When reshaping a singleton integer, don't create an APA unless
    the result has > 1 elements.  That way, we don't promote from
    Boolean in singleton result case which can mess up Reduction
    of a Singleton.
