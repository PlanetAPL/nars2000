Build #561 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Change Binding Strength For Strands To The Right Of A Dyadic
  Operator

Directory trunk:

FREE.C:
  In <FreeResultSub>, handle incoming character and numeric strands.
  In <FreeResultGlobalFcn>, use <LPFCNARRAY_HEADER> instead of
    a cast to aid in debugging.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define new tokens that correspond to various variables to the
    right of a dyadic operator.
  Define new terminal <Drv5Func> for use in
    <ArrExpr: ArrExpr Drv5Func StrandInst> and
    <LeftOper: (Drv5Func)>.
  Define new rule that allows assignment of <Drv3Func> to a name.
  Split out assignment to a name of <MonOp Drv1Func> and
    <MonOp Drv3Func>.
  Split out assignment to a name of <AmbOp Drv2Func> and
    <AmbOp Drv3Func>.
  In any rule with <error> and a <LeftOper>, free the <LeftOper>
    only if it is not a named function/operator.
  Include in <ArrExpr:> the rules <ArrExpr Drv3Func> and
    <ArrExpr Drv4Func>.
  Define new terminals <SingOp2Var:> and <StrandOp2> to collect
    possible variable targets to the right of a dyadic operator.
  Include in <SelectSpec:> the rule <SelectSpec Drv3Func>.
  Define new rule <Drv3Func:> for use in <FcnSpec:> and
    <ArrExpr:> becuase the strand on the right is bound to the
    dyadic operator.
  Augment new rule <Drv4Func:> for use in <FcnSpec:>,
    <ArrExpr:  ArrExpr Drv4Func> and <LeftOper: MonOp Drv4Func>.
  Define new rule <Drv5Func:> for use in
    <ArrExpr: ArrExpr Drv5Func StrandInst> and <LeftOper: (Drv5Func)>.
  In <LookAheadDyadicOp>, handle right grouping tokens by
    ignoring them rather than skipping over the entire group.
  In <pl_yylex>, check for an adjacent dyadic operator upon
    encountering a VARIMMED, VARARRAY (return <OP2CONSTANT>),
    VARNAMED (return OP2NAMEVAR>), CHRSTRAND (return <OP2CHRSTRAND>)
    or NUMSTRAND (return <OP2NUMSTRAND>).

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define new function to determine whether or not a token type is
    that of a named function/operator.
