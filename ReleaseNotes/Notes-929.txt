* Fix Bug:  Tab Delete Fails To Select The Current Tab

Directory trunk:

TABCTRL.C:
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCM_DELETEITEM>, if the current tab and the
    deleted tab are at the leftmost, <gOverTabIndex> is decremented
    when it should be left alone.
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCM_DELETEITEM>, the call to <TabCtrl_GetCurSel>
    returns -1 because it is issued too soon after the call to delete a
    tab.  Instead, we select the new tab explicitly.
