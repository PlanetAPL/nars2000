DISPLAY.C:
  Update the copyright notice.
  In <FormatAplFltFC>, if the number is zero, ensure negative sign is appended under all <FLTDISPFMT_x>s.

  Update the copyright notice.
  For the various <SIGN_xxx> macros, ensure the result is of type <UBOOL> so it fits in a smaller width.
  Define <mpfr_sgn0> macro in terms of <signumint>.
  Remove <mpfr_neg0> macro as it's no longer needed.

MPFNS.C:
  Update the copyright notice.
  Pass new arg to <mpz_QuadICValue>, <mpq_QuadICValue>, and <mpfr_QuadICValue> to handle negation of the result.
  In <mpfr_invalid> raise a <NONCE ERROR> exception for sqrt of negative infinity as per HC2 values.
