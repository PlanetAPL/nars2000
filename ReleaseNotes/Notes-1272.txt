Build #1272 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug Of Displaying Error Message After )RESET
* Fix Bug Of Displaying Magic Function Line In Error Message
* Remove References To LookAhead/Behind/Stop As They Are No Longer Used

Directory trunk:

ERRMSG.C:
  In <AppendFcnNameLineNum>, include bit flag argument for whether or not a caller is []EC.
  Rename struc member <ItsEC> to <bItsEC> to reflect its Boolean nature.
  In <AppendFcnNameLineNum>, fix bug where we incorrectly returned a
    (locked) global memory ptr (never to unlock it) instead of an HGLOBAL.
  In <AppendFcnNameLineNum>, if we're in an MFO wind back the stack to the UDFO
    and return that functionname[line #].
  In <AppendFcnNameLineNum>, if the function name is valid andwe're not under control of []EC, suspend execution at this level.
  In <ErrorMessageDirect>, handle return of immediate execution line instead of global memory handle.

EXECDFN.C:
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, return NoValue token if EXITTYPE_RESET_ALL so we don't display an error message.
  Improve comments.
  Rename struc member <ItsEC> to <bItsEC> to reflect its Boolean nature.

EXECMFN.C:
FH_PARSE.H:
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.

GOTO.C:
  Rename struc member <ItsEC> to <bItsEC> to reflect its Boolean nature.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Make test in <if> statement explicit.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedMF_A>, save the current function caret position for later use.
  Remove references to LookAhead/Behind/Stop as they are no longer used.
  In <ParseLine>, save a ptr to the local vars in the SIS header.
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.
  Rename struc member <ItsEC> to <bItsEC> to reflect its Boolean nature.
  If we suspend in an MFO, reset the error codes so we don't execute []ELX at this level.
  Make test in <if> statement explicit.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Remove references to LookAhead/Behind/Stop as they are no longer used.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <FillSISNxt>, include references to all <SIS_HEADER> members even if commented out.
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.

QF_EA.C:
QF_EC.C:
  Rename struc member <ItsEC> to <bItsEC> to reflect its Boolean nature.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.

SC_SI.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.

SIS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename struct member <PermFn> to <bMFO> to parallel <bAFO>.
  Include struct member of current function caret position.
  Include struct member of ptr to this level's ParselLine Local Vars.

TOKENS.H:
  Remove references to LookAhead/Behind/Stop as they are no longer used.
