Build #589 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug With )RESET

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY> when returning from the function,
    if we're resetting all levels, don't bother creating a
    No Value result.

SC_RESET.C:
  In <CmdReset_EM>, set the immediate execution exit type so
    that <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY> can use it.
