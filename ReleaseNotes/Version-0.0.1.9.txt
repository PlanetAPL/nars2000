Version 0.0.1.9 consists of the following Builds:


Build #351 -- Version 0.0.1.9
-----------------------------

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  Mark as called from <ParseFunctionName> so as to
    generate fewer errors and thus have a better chance
    to extract the function name.

FH_PARSE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define bit to indicate called by <ParseFunctionName>.
  Fix typo in comment.

FH_PARSE.Y:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new token <NOMORE> to handle certain syntax errors
    when called from <ParseFunctionName>.
  Avoid calling <fh_yyerror> in circumstances where we're
    called from <ParseFunctionname> and we have already parsed
    the function name.
  Fix Bug:  In <fh_yyerror> when run under DEBUG and
    <AppVerifier>, the code can crash by reading beyond the
    end of a buffer.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <Train:>, allow <AxisFunc> as an alternative to <LeftOper>
    everywhere.
  Fix Bug:  In <Train:> when an error occurs, convert the <Train>
    into a Train before freeing it.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Allow empty or missing "nn=" in the .ini file.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Fix comment.
  Avoid writing out []WSID as a system variable as it is
    of no use.
  Write out the value of []WSID to the [General] section.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <IsLocalName>, include braces in the list of
    leading/terminating symbols when determining whether or
    not a given name is local to a function.  This means that
    names in braces in a function header are no longer incorrectly
    Syntax Colored as global to the function.

WORKSPACE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define keyname for WSID= in the [General] section.


Directory trunk\MediaWiki\extensions:

APL.CSS:
  Define APL class and include "APLX Upright" font in
    list of APL fonts.
