Build #579 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Outer Product With A Non-scalar Operand Fails In Certain Cases

Directory trunk:

PO_JOTDOT.C:
  Rename <lpPrimFlags> to <lpPrimFlagsRht> to maintain consistency
    with other operator naming conventions.
  Fix Bug:  Set <lpPrimFlagsRht> to <PrimFlags0> if the flags
    are not present.
  Recode <PrimOpDydJotDotProto_EM> as prototype-only function, and
    move the previous function contents to inline use.
  By Mistake, this file was included in the previous Build.
