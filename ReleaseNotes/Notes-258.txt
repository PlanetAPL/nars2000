Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Omit old DEF_CURLINE_xxx.
  Rename all names containing NumAlp/NUMALP to just Num/NUM as Alp is done with Str.
  Rename all names containing String/STRING to just Str/STR.
  Change initial size for Num and Str and define incremental values, too.

PERTAB.H:
  Omit initialization of <iMaxNumAlp> and <iMaxString> as we now use the DEF_NUM_MAXSIZE or DEF_STR_MAXSIZE.
  Include in comments initialization of <iNumLim> and <iStrLim> to zero.
  Replace <lpszNumAlp>/<lpwszString> with <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr>.
  Rename all names containing NumAlp/NUMALP to just Num/NUM as Alp is done with Str.
  Rename all names containing String/STRING to just Str/STR.
  Define limit vars for Num/Str to track the current size of <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr>.
  Renumber all subsequent entries.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Fix bug in <ParseSavedWsFcn>/<ParseSavedWsVar> where when parsing multiple globals,
    the trailing data may be overwritten.

SESSMAN.C:
  Improve comments.
  Define temp var for <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr>.
  Replace <VirtualAlloc>/<VirtualFree> of <lpszNumAlp>/<lpwszString> with <GlobalAlloc> of <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr>.
  In WM_MDIACTIVATE, set the focus to the current SM window in case that helps with cases where
    SM didn't get the focus as expected (probably cross thread issues).

TOKENIZE.C:
  Rename all names containing NumAlp/NUMALP to just Num/NUM as Alp is done with Str.
  Rename all names containing String/STRING to just Str/STR.
  Define and use two functions to check for resizing of <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr>.
  Use <hGlbNum>/<hGlbStr> instead of <lpszNumAlp>/<lpwszString> to reduce the need for
    reserved address space from <VirtualAlloc>.
