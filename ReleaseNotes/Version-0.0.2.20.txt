Version 0.0.2.20 consists of the following Builds:


Build #788 -- Version 0.0.2.20
------------------------------

* Make Apply Button Work In Keyboards Font Selection

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Reorganize data section.
  Move keyboard font handle to data section from static var so it can
    be used by <SetKeybFont> when called from <MyChooseFontHook>.
  Display Tooltip for Keyboards Font button.
  Handle request for Tooltip text for Keyboards Font button.
  Move set of Property Page handle to inside <SetKeybFont> so it may be
    called from <MyChooseFontHook> if the user clicks on the Apply button.

MAIN.C:
  In <MyChooseFontHook> include a handler for when the user clicks on the
    Apply button and set the keyboard fonts.


Build #787 -- Version 0.0.2.20
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Calculate Printer Metrics Correctly

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Display Tooltip for Fonts Static Text and Buttons.
  Comment out Theme functions we don't use.
  Improve comments.
  Use new routine <GetLogPixelsY> to return commonly used value.
  As the Customize dialog is now modeless, use <DestroyWindow> to end the
    dialog instead of <EndDialog>.
  Rename <IDC_FONTx> to <IDC_FONTSx> to be consistent with other Fonts names.
  Define new routine to handle subclassing of Fonts Static Text controls to
    relay mouse events to the Tooltip control.
  Define new routine to return a ptr to a string that describes the Font Weight.

EDITFCN.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <LclECPaintHook> when printing, convert the printer point size
    from screen coords to printer coords.

MAIN.C:
  Use new routine <GetLogPixelsY> to return commonly used value.
  Remove DC parameter from <CreateNewFontCom> as it's no longer used.

Build #786 -- Version 0.0.2.20
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Set Owner Of ChooseFont Dialog To Avoid Problems

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  The owner listed in the ChooseFontW struc for the various fonts must be
    changed to that of the Fonts property page so that the Customize dialog
    can't be closed with the ChooseFontW dialog open.
  Use <TTN_GETDISPINFOW> consistently instead of <TTN_NEEDTEXTW>.
  In <TTN_GETDISPINFOW:>, if the <TOOLINFOW> struc used <TTF_IDISHWND>, we must
    convert the <idCtl> to its corresponding <CtrlID>.

MAIN.C:
  Use <TTN_GETDISPINFOW> consistently instead of <TTN_NEEDTEXTW>.
  Now that the Customize dialog is modeless, we must check for it already being
    open and disallow a second copy.

  Improve comments.

    use OwnerDraw to paint the buttons.
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.
  Delete the code to create, use, and destroy a special font for
    the Fonts buttons, which are no longer ownerdrawn.
  Provide Tooltips for the Keyboard Layout Combobox and special
    Keycaps.
  Draw the Keycap buttons ourselves in WM_DRAWITEM.  Previously,
    I used NMCUSTOMDRAW, but Wine doesn't support that so I changed.

INIFILE.C:

    to zero as it represents the # of files in the .ini file, which is zero
    at the start.
  When allocating glkobal memory for the Recent Files, use <DEF_RECENTFILES>
    as that's the maximum we keep track of.
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.

KEYBOARDS.H:
  Separate more keyboard layout names into Glb and Lcl versions
    so a final Cancel changes nothing after the last Apply.

MAIN.C:
  ToolTip => Tooltip.

    separately.
  In <MFWndProc/WM_CLOSE:>, if the Customize dialog is still open,
    check ask it to close and if the user doesn't want to, fail the return.
  Remove font handle for the Font buttons as we no longer need it.
  Define new function to handle <MFWndProc/TCN_SELCHANGE:>.

MAIN.RC:

  Change the Keyboards property page Keycap buttons to be ownerdrawn.

REBAR.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Improve comments.
  Change from <_TrackMouseEvent> to <SetCapture/ReleaseCapture> as
    Wine doesn't handle the former well.
  Create separate Tooltip windows for the toolbars so we don't need to
    avoid leakage of parameters between the various uses.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc>, handle <WM_SETFONT>.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc>, handle <WM_LBUTTONUP>.
  In <LclWS_ED_OWToolbarWndProc/WM_DESTROY:>, destroy the Tooltip
    window instead of deleting the various tools.
  Define a new function to set the maximum tip width to depend upon the
    Tooltip font in use.
