* Fix Bug In Syntax Coloring Of Local System Names

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <IsLocalName>, two constant vars are marked as static.
  In <IsLocalName>, the incoming system name is converted to lower case,
    but not the target name.  Instead, we just use a case-insensitive
    compare for system names and a case-sensitive compare for all others.
