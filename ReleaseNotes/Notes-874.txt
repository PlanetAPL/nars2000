Build #874 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Ensure That VFP Modulus Result Is Less Than Modulus

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Don't compile FLINT DEBUG stmts if Win64 (FLINT not available).

INITDATA.C:
  Omit precision save stmts as they are unused.

MPFNS.C:
  Remove Assert stmts as they fail on Win64 DEBUG.
  Fix Bug:  Call <mpf_mod_sub> until the result is less than the modulus
    as the precision limitations might require that.

NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Synchronize the 32- and 64-bit versions.
