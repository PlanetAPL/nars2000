Build #776 -- Version 0.0.2.19
------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Slicing Dyadic Transpose

Directory trunk:

AXISFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename loop counter <u> to longer name <uCnt> so it can be searched
    for more easily.
  Declare <lpDup> as <APLBOOL> so it doesn't have to be cast when used.
  Fix Bug:  If duplicate axes are allowed, do same test as for
    contiguous axes, and then test for starting at 0 (after converting
    to origin-0).
