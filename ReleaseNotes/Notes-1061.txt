Build #1061 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPINIT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process.

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process, and on a fast system
    may trigger an error message saying that "The process cannot access the
    file because it is being used by another process.".

ECHODOT.TXT:
  A one-byte file containing a dot ".".  No trailing CR/LF is present so that
    typing the file from multiple calls spits out a series of dots all on one
    line until it wraps at the right edge of the CMD window.

VER.RC:
  Increment version # to 0.3.9.xx.
