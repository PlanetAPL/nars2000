Build #888 -- Version 0.0.3.2
-----------------------------

* Miscellaneous DEBUG Changes

Directory trunk:

PF_CSTAR.C:
  Reorganize code to use <#ifdef OWN_EXPLOG>.

PF_STAR.C:
  Insert DEBUG stmts around debug stmt.










CUSTOMIZE.C:
SYSVARS.H:
  Rename <DEF_MAX_QUADPP> to <DEF_MAX_QUADPPVFP> to make it clear.

DISPLAY.C:
  In <FormatExpFmt>, pass the maximum precision.
  In <FormatAplVfpFC>, if we're not displaying in E-notation, format the
    number at maximum precision so we can tell when not enough digits
    have been displayed and []PP is too small.
  Improve comments.
  Calculate the # digits in the number's precision so as to calculate
    the # trailing underflow digits correctly.
  If we didn't display all the digits in the number, display it in E-notation.

EXECDFN.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
SESSMAN.C:
  Rename <InitVfpConstants> as <InitVfpPrecision> as that's all it does now.

EXTERNS.H:
  Remove <nDigitsFPC> as we now calculate it on the fly.

INITDATA.C:
  Rename <InitVfpConstants> as <InitVfpPrecision> as that's all it does now.
  Round up to multiple of 32 the precision passed to <mpfr_set_default_prec>
    as that matches the granularity of precision of <mpf_xxx> functions and
    simplifies issues when converting between the two.
  Remove <nDigitsFPC> as we now calculate it on the fly.

SYSVARS.C:
  Rename <InitVfpConstants> as <InitVfpPrecision> as that's all it does now.
  Rename <DEF_MAX_QUADPP> to <DEF_MAX_QUADPPVFP> to make it clear.
