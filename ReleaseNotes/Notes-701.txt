* Fix Bug:  Dyadic Iota Doesn't Handle Left Boolean Not Full Byte Not Found

Directory trunk:

PF_IOTA.C
  Improve comments.
  In <PrimFnDydIotaBvB> and <PrimFnDydIotaBvN> if we don't find a right arg
    value, use the <NotFound> value instead of the value which indicates we
    didn't find the right arg value as it is always <NBIB> (8).
