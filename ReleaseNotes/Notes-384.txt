Build #384 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

SC_LOAD.C:
  In <ParseSavedWsFcn_EM>, reorganize local vars to be local to their
    specific part.
  Fix Bug:  In <ParseSavedWsFcn_EM>, if there's a previous definition of the function,
    increment its reference count so it won't be freed by <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM>.
  In <ParseSavedWsFcn_EM>, move local to narrower scope so it's clear
    that we don't need to clear it at the end.
  Fix Bug:  In <ParseSavedWsFcn_EM>, if freeing the previous global, don't clear
    the STE flags as the STE is still active.
  In <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM> when loading a user-defined function/operator,
    move the line which sets <SF_Fcns.LclParams> to be nearer other
    similar lines.
