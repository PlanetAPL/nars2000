Build #876 -- Version 0.0.3.1
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Use Same GMP/MPIR/MPFR Headers As Static Libraries

Directory trunk:

HEADERS.H:
  Include <mpir.h> as it is needed to define <mp_bitcnt_t>.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Set MPIR and MPFR include directories to same files as used
    in the static libraries.
