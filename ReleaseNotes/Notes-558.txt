Build #558 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  The Display of Floating Point Numbers Sometimes
  Doesn't Display Correctly

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  In <DisplayGlbArr_EM>, remove references to []PW as it isn't used.
  In <FormatFloatFC>, rename <bIntegral> to <bPowerOfTwo> as that's
    what is represents.
  In <FormatFloatFC>, when displaying raw floating point numbers,
    don't change the <dtoaMode> from <DTOAMODE_SHORT_RND> as that'll
    provide maximum precision in minimum width.
