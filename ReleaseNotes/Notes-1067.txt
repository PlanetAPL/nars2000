PF_IOTA.C:

    as using System []CT, and use <sx> suffix instead of <sa> to match that of the MPIR library for 64-bit integers.
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
  In <PrimFnDydIota_EM_YY>, get and pass []CT down to the various subroutines rather than getting it in each.
  Rename <PrimFnDydIotaIvI_EM> to <PrimFnDydIotaIvN_EM> to cover all right arg numeric cases.
  Rename <PrimFnDydIotaNvN_EM> to <PrimFnDydIotaFvN_EM> as it handles only right arg float cases.
  Improve comments.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaIvN_EM> where the <IvF> case was missed.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaRvN_EM> where in the <RvF> case the right arg is mistakenly converted to an integer.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaRvN_EM> where we need to compare w.r.t. []CT in the <RvV> and <RvF> cases.
  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> where in the <VvF> case the right arg is mistakenly converted to an integer.
  In <PrimFnDydIotaOther>, pass the proper function token to the Match function.
  Fix bug in dyadic iota where for everything but I vs. B/I/A/F/R/V and R vs. B/I/A/R, if we search
    for a number that occurs after a larger number that is within []CT of the
    searched for number, we miss it.  For example, 1 2 (3+1e{neg}10) 3 {iota} 3
    where []CT is 1e{neg}10.  After we find a match and have searched
    down through lower indices to GradeUp, the fix is then to search up through
    higher indices to GradeUp for values within []CT with lower argument indices.
