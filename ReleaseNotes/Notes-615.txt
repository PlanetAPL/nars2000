Build #615 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Merge INDEX_xxx and UTF16_xxx For Primitive Functions

Directory trunk:

EXECFNS.C:
  Replace INDEX_xxx with UTF16_xxx for primitive functions as we no
    longer need the former.  We still need them for operators as
    functions and operators share the same table <PrimProtoFnsTab>.

EXTERNS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Widen the primitive function and operator tables by one bit so we
    don't need to use the INDEX_xxx equates for primitive functions.

INITDATA.C:
PL_PARSE.Y:
PO_DIJOT.C:
SYMTRANS.C:
TRANSLATE.C:
UNICODE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Replace INDEX_xxx with UTF16_xxx for primitive functions as we no
    longer need the former.  We still need them for operators as
    functions and operators share the same table <PrimProtoFnsTab>.
