Build #720 -- Version 0.0.2.17
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  After )RESET Sometimes A Double Indent Occurs

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  Test for )RESET before displaying the six-space indent.
    Depending upon the order of thread termination, the six-
    space indent might occur twice.

SESSMAN.C:
  Remove debugging code as the problem is thread-related.

SYSCMDS.C:
  In <ExecSysCmd>, return the type of system command.
