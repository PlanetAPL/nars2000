Build #441 -- Version 0.0.1.15
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.H:
  Move the DEBUG version signatures of the <FMTxxxSTR>s to the end so
    as to have the same offsets in the non-DEBUG and DEBUG versions
    as well as make it easier to find bugs that show up in the non-DEBUG
    version only.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <CompileArrNestedGlb>, when displaying an array such as
      1 (0 0{rho}0)
    although there are no columns in the second element, nonetheless
    <lpFmtColStr> is used even though it's invalid.  This causes the
    ptr to increment an element in the preceding <FMTROWSTR> instead
    of the expected <FMTCOLSTR> and results in too many empty rows in
    the display.  This bug evidences itself only in the non-DEBUG
    version because the DEBUG version starts each <FMTxxxSTR> entry
    with a signature which is what the incorrect ptr increments,
    harmlessly.
