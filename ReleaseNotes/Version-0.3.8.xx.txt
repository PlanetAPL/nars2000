    so we can repeat by rows cols that wrap.
  At the end of compiling an array, propagate the row and col counts up the line.
  Zero all of row strucs, rather than item by item.
  In <CompileArrNested>, keep track of current and previous NOTCHAR+ as per APL2 rules.
  Pass 1st and last col flags to <CompileARrNestedCon> for proper spacing.
  In <CompileArrNested>, do leading and trailing blanks in the subroutines
    so we use the same col struc used for intermediate blanks.
  In <FormatArrSimple>, wrap groups of rows at []PW instead of individual lines.
