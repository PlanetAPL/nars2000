Build #1013 -- Version 0.3.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Display Wrapped Lines As A Group Of Rows

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  Delete 1st and last col flags from <CompileArrNested> as they are no
    longer used.
  Use raw output for all non-nested arrays as chars are displayed natively.
  Improve comments.
  Wrap lines at []PW in groups of rows instead of line by line.

DISPLAY.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Split out bit fields into separate UINTs.
  Define new row struc fields to handle wrapped lines for long numbers.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
  Delete 1st and last col flags from <CompileArrNested> as they are no
    longer used.
  Improve comments.
  Implement display spacing as per APL2 description.
  When compiling arrays, save the first and last ptrs to the formatted data
    so we can repeat by rows cols that wrap.
  At the end of compiling an array, propagate the row and col counts up the line.
  Zero all of row strucs, rather than item by item.
  In <CompileArrNested>, keep track of current and previous NOTCHAR+ as per APL2 rules.
  Pass 1st and last col flags to <CompileARrNestedCon> for proper spacing.
  In <CompileArrNested>, do leading and trailing blanks in the subroutines
    so we use the same col struc used for intermediate blanks.
  In <FormatArrSimple>, wrap groups of rows at []PW instead of individual lines.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include additional entry points to aid in debugging.
