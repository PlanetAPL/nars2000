Build #734 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  0 {log} 0 Should Be 1 Not DOMAIN ERROR

Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Change the default value in []IC for 0 {log} 0 from DOMAIN ERROR to 1.

INIFILE.C:
  Define a new section for Migration issues.
  Define a new keyname for []IC and 0 {log} 0.
  Define a new struct for Migration issues.
  In <ReadIniFileGlb> after reading in the CWS value for []IC, read in
    the []IC 0 {log} 0 migration level.  If it hasn't been set as yet,
    change the just read in value to the new default value and increment
    the old migration level so we don't do this again.
  In <SaveIniFile>, write out the new Migration Level values.

PF_CSTAR.C:
  Define a 2 by 2 table of []IC indices for the Boolean vs. Boolean cases.
  In <PrimFnDydCircleStarFisIvI>, use the above table instead of a
    SWITCH stmt.
  In <PrimFnDydCircleStarFisIvI>, check for the L = R case, and return
    the value 1 as the EAS says to do.
  In <PrimFnDydCircleStarFisIvI>, check the result for +/- Infinity.
  In <PrimFnDydCircleStarFisFvF>, move the 2 by 2 table to global.
  In <PrimFnDydCircleStarFisFvF>, check for the L = R case, and return
    the value 1 as the EAS says to do.
