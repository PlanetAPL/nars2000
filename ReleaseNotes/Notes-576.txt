Build #576 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Handle Numeric Strand To Left of Ambiguous Operator

Directory trunk:

MACROS.H:
  Define new macros for <DbgIncrRefCntTkm> and <DbgDecrRefCntTkn>.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <ArrExpr:  error AmbOp StrandOp1>, don't free <StrandOp1>
    as it hasn't had RefCnt incremented by <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>.
  In <ArrExpr:  ArrExpr AmbOp StrandOp1>, increment the RefCnt
    for <StrandOp1> as it doesn't go through <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY>
    as usual because this instance <AmbOp> isn't an operator.

REFCNT.C:
  Clear the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag on decrement because if it's not
    increment that flag is no longer meaningful.
  Define new routines to increment/decrement RefCnt given a token.
