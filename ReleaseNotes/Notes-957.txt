* Fix Bug In N-wise Reduce

Directory trunk:

PF_CSTILE.C:
PF_SLASH.C:
PF_SLOPE.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Test for correct function (CircleStile vs. CircleBar or Slash vs. SlashBar
    or Slope vs. SlopeBar) when calculating the axis value.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Test for correct function (Slash vs. SlashBar) when calculating the axis value.
  Delete special case of N-wise reduce where the left arg is the negative of the
    axis length.  Not only do we not need this special case, but it's wrong as
    the function passed to <PrimFnMonCircleStile_EM_YY> isn't one of CircleStile
    or CircleBar, so the result is calculated on the wrong dimension.
