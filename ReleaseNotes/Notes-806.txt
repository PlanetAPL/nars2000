Build #806 -- Version 0.0.2.23
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Execute Without Result May Crash

Directory trunk:

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCommon_EM_YY>, rather than assert that
    there's a result, test for it and if none, fall through to
    the NoValue code.
