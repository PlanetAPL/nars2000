Build #547 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Double-clicking on a name spelt with an underbar fails

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <IzitNameChar>, the individual tests for a valid char in a name
    missed underbar, so instead of just addding that, the new version
    uses the existing function <IsValid2ndCharInName> (which includes
    <IsValid1stCharInName>).  This means that double-clicking on a
    name that includes an underbar, now displays the function (if any)
    of that name.
