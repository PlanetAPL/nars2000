* Fix Bug:  Handle Vars In Function Strands on )LOAD

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
DISPLAY.C:
STRAND.C:
  Pass function entry point and parameters to convert a global
    memory object to a function.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Before loading a var or fcn/opr, check to see if its has already
    been loaded.
  Before calling execute to create a function array, skip over the
    source ptr past its trailing zero so the memory may be serially
    reusable.

SC_SAVE.C:
  In <CmdSave_EM>, increment <uGlbCnt> after use so as to allow
    for multiple functions in one line (function strand).
  In <SavedWsFormGlbFcn>, pass a ptr to the function name for
    later use.
  In <SavedWsFormGlbFcn>, rename <lpGlbCnt> to <lpuGlbCnt> to
    match its use outside that function.
  Pass function entry point and parameters to convert a global
    memory object to a function.
  In <SavedWsFormGlbFcn>, increment <uGlbCnt> after use so as to
    allow for multiple functions in one line (function strand).
  In <SavedWsFormGlbFcn>, setup <SavedWsGlbFcnParm> to be passed to
    function strand display functions.
  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar>, rename <lpGlbCnt> to <lpuGlbCnt> to
    match its use outside that function.
  Define <SavedWsGlbFcnConv> as callback function from display
    functions when displaying global functions.

WORKSPACE.H:
  Rename <lpGlbCnt> to <lpuGlbCnt> to match its use outside
    that function.
  Define typedef for <SavedWsGlbFcnConv> parameters.
