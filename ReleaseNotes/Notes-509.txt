Build #509-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Generate the correct identity element for catenate reduction empty

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  Define additional arg to <CopyGlbMemory> to use <MyGlobalAlloc> so it can
    be used in <CopyArray_EM>.

EXECFNS.C:
  Define new function <ExecFcnStrLine_EM_YY> to allow passing of starting
    line # type.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbPtrs_LOCK>, handle <TKT_FCNARRAY> case.
  In <GetPrototypeFcnPtr>, split out FCNARRAY_HEADERs from DFN_HEADERs.

PF_COMMA.C:
  Improve comments.
  Goto ERROR_EXIT instead of returning directly so as to maintain
    a common exit point.
  Include additional assertion about the incoming function.

PO_DIERESIS.C:
  Get the operand axis token along with the operator axis token and
    use them in the appropriate places.

PO_DITILDE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix errors in comments.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Generate the correct identity elenment for catenate reduction empty.
  Call user-defined fucntion/operator at []IDENTITY if reducing empty.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define additional arg to <CopyGlbMemory> to use <MyGlobalAlloc> so it can
    be used in <CopyArray_EM>.
  In <CopyArray_EM>, split out arrays of variables from arrays of functions.
  Define new routine to determine if a token is a user-defined function/operator.
