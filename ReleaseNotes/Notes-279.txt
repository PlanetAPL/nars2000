Build #279 -- Version 0.0.0.18148
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
  Tell <HshTabFrisk> which HshTab to frisk.

COMMON.C:
  Change from registry to .ini file for storing program-specific data.
  Rename <GetFileNames> to <GetModuleFileNames> to reflect the module aspect better.
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.

COMPRO.H:
  Change from registry to .ini file for storing program-specific data.

CONVERT.C:
  Rename <CharToName> to <CharToSymbolName> to reflect the symbol aspect better.
  Rename <NameToChar> to <SymbolNameToChar> to reflect the symbol aspect better.

DISPDBG.C:
  Tell <DisplayHshTab> which HshTab to display.
  Improve comments.

DISPLAY.C:
  Fix typo in comments.

EDITFCN.C:
  Skip changing []PW on WM_SIZE if width is zero.

EXECDFN.C:
  Fix typo in comment.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define global HshTab constants.

INIFILE.C:
  Change from registry to .ini file for storing program-specific data.

MACROS.H:
  Surround macro args in parens to avoid undesired scope changes.

MAIN.C:
  Use equate for program name.
  Rename <LAPPEND_DEBUG> to <WS_APPEND_DEBUG> to reflect wide chars better.
  Change from registry to .ini file for storing program-specific data.
  Include <Assert> after assigning <hGlbPTD>.
  In <TCN_SELCHANGE>, skip hide if tabs are the same.
  Allocate separate HshTab for use with translations to/from {symbol} names as that
    transl;ation doesn't need a symbol table.  This way, we don't need to be dependent
    upon <hGlbPTD> being defined.
  Rename <GetFileNames> to <GetModuleFileNames> to reflect the module aspect better.
  Create %APPDATA% directories early on before reading from the .ini file.
  Initialize symbol names before reading from the .ini file.

MAKEFILE:
  Include <userenv.lib> as we need it to obtain %APPDATA% value from the environment block.
  Change from registry to .ini file for storing program-specific data.

PERTAB.H:
  Move HshTab data into struc so we can more easily switch between the two HshTabs.

PF_DSHOE.C:
  Fix typo in comment.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
  Improve comments.

PF_RHO.C:
  Fix typo in comment.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

QF_SYSID.C:
  Use equate for program name.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Fix typo in comments.
  Rename <NameToChar> to <SymbolNameToChar> to reflect the symbol aspect better.

SC_COPY.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.

SC_DROP.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.

SC_LIB.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.
  Rename <NameToChar> to <SymbolNameToChar> to reflect the symbol aspect better.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.
  Improve comments.
  Rename <CharToName> to <CharToSymbolName> to reflect the symbol aspect better.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

SC_WSID.C:
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

SESSMAN.C:
  Define enum for entries in <lpLclMemVirtStr> in PerTabData.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
  Move initialization of symbol names to <MAIN.C>
  In debug version, display both HshTabs on <VK_F2>.

SYMTAB.C:
  Tell various functions which HshTab to use.
  Make code independent of which HshTab is being used.
  Improve comments.
  Avoid calling <dprintfW> and <DbgMsgW> unless <hGlbPTD> from the thread is valid (crash).
  Rename <AppendCharValue> and <AppendCharName> to <AppendSymbolValue> and <AppendSymbolName>
    to reflect their purpose better.
  In <AppendSymbolValue> and <AppendSymbolName>, remove dependency on <hGlbPTD> as
    it isn't defined when we use these functions.
  Rename <InitCharNameValues> to <InitSymbolNameValues> to reflect its purpose better.
  Rename <CharToName> to <CharToSymbolName> to reflect the symbol aspect better.

SYMTAB.H:
  Delete commented out lines.

SYSVARS.C:
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
  Tell <HshTabFrisk> which HshTab to frisk.
  Use <lpwszWorkDir> in AppData instead of <wszWorkDir> in same dir as program.
  Use CWS or system value of SysVar depending upon global bit (which will ultimately be
    selectable from a user option dialog).
  Rename <bQuadxSA> to <cQuadxSA> as the value isn't Boolean.

SYSVARS.H:
  Define braces version of default []FC for use in <ReadIniFileGlb>.
  Define wide-string version of default []ALX/[]ELX for use in <ReadIniFileGlb>.

TABCTRL.C:
  Improve comments.
  Include <Assert> after assigning <hGlbPTD>.
  In <TCM_DELETEITEM>, tell the Master Frame about the change in tab selection.

TRANSLATE.C:
  In <TranslateTabIndexToID>, check for invalid index or <hGlbPTD>.

VER.RC:
  Use equate for program name.


Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Delete debug statements.
