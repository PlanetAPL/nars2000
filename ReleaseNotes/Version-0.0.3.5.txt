COMPRO.H:
  Include prototype file for native file functions.

ENUMS.H:
  Define enum for the common routine for []NERASE, []NRENAME, and []NRESIZE.

EXTERNS.H:
  Include new column for <FastBoolTrans> to reverse the bits in a byte.

  Include <qf_nfns.c>.

PERTAB.H:
  Include global memory handle for native file functions structures.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Split apart <CalcDataSize> from <CalcArraySize>.  Originally, I thought I needed this
    for native file functions, but I changed my mind.

QF_DR.C:
  Omit <qf_dr.h> as it's now in <headers.h>.

QF_DR.H:

  Update copyright year.
  Define new sort function for sorting 8-byte integers.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include names of native file functions.

SYSVARS.C:
  Remove references to prototype functions as we no longer need them.
  Include native file functions.

Build #960 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Include More Headers For Prototypes

Directory msieve:

COMMON.H:
  Include more headers as we need them for prototypes.


Build #959 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Include <float.h> In <headers.h>

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
HEADERS.H:
INITDATA.C:
MPIFNS.C:
PF_BAR.C:
PF_CIRCLE.C:
PF_COLONBAR.C:
PF_CSTAR.C:
PF_DCARET.C:
PF_DSTILE.C:
PF_DTACKJOT.C:
PF_PLUS.C:
PF_QDOT.C:
PF_ROOT.C:
PF_STILE.C:
PF_UCARET.C:
PRIMFNS.C:
TYPEMOTE.C:
  Include <float.h> in <headers.h> as we need some of its defines in lots of places.


Build #958 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Change Algorithm Used For Primality Test

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  Change from <mpz_probable_prime_p> to <mpz_likely_prime_p> as the latter is faster.


Build #957 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug In N-wise Reduce

Directory trunk:

PF_CSTILE.C:
PF_SLASH.C:
PF_SLOPE.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Test for correct function (CircleStile vs. CircleBar or Slash vs. SlashBar
    or Slope vs. SlopeBar) when calculating the axis value.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Test for correct function (Slash vs. SlashBar) when calculating the axis value.
  Delete special case of N-wise reduce where the left arg is the negative of the
    axis length.  Not only do we not need this special case, but it's wrong as
    the function passed to <PrimFnMonCircleStile_EM_YY> isn't one of CircleStile
    or CircleBar, so the result is calculated on the wrong dimension.


Build #956 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Reorder []DR Constants

Directory trunk:

QF_DR.C:
  Move []DR constants to their own header file.
  Reorder []DR constants so that all numeric types are adjacent.
  Remove bit size from 32- vs. 64-bit HETERO/NESTED/RATIONAL/VFP constants
    as it unnecessarily complicates the function.
  Allow for COMPLEX/QUATERNION/OCTONION numbers whose coefficients may all be
    any of INTEGER, FLOAT, RATIONAL, or VFP.

QF_DR.H:
   New file containing []DR constants.


Build #955 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Use Overbar Instead Of Hyphen In Language Bar

Directory trunk:

REBAR.C:
  Use overbar instead of hyphen in language bar.


Build #954 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Remove Two LIMIT ERRORs During Tokenize

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Undefine <DEF_NUM_MAXNELM> and <DEF_STR_MAXNELM> as they are no longer used.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Remove out-of-range checks for numerics and strings as the global memory
    handle is automatically increased in size.


Build #953 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Include Bitsize In Master Frame Window Title

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
MAIN.C:
