Build #669 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Use Temporary Section For Deletable Entries When Saving A Workspace

Directory trunk:

SC_SAVE.C:
  Use "sss" consistently as the SI level count in comments.
  Use [TempGlobals] section in saved workspace file to hold
    those entries which get deleted after the workspace is
    saved.  This means we no longer need the SymLink chain
    and all of its supporting code.
  Improve comments.
  When formatting an immediate value, use a SWITCH stmt so as
    to catch missing cases.
  When formatting the global object name (:xxxxxxxx), make room
    for all chars in 64-bit environment.
  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar>, merge the formatting of NESTED and
    HETERO objects.
  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar>, format characters the same way as
    elsewhere as "x" or "\xNNNN".

WORKSPACE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new section for workspaces which holds the temporary
    entries which get deleted after the workspace is saved.
