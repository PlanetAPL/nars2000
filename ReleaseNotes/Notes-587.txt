Build #587 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Failed to Clear YYCopyArray Flag

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Fix Bug:  In <pl_yylex> when setting the incoming var <lpYYLval>,
    the <YYCopyArray> flag wasn't cleared, so the previous value
    could (and did) leak through.

STRAND.C:
  In <MakeFcnStrand_EM_YY> when dealing with a <YYCopyArray>ed arg,
    the entire current strand on the stack was freed instead of just
    the <YYCopyArray>ed entry.

YYFNS.C:
  Optimize the DEBUG code to take advantage of common code.
