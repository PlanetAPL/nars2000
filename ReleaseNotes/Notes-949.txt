* Fix Bug In Reduction Of RAT/VFP Numbers

Directory trunk:

PO_SLASH.C:
  When calling <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>, don't pass result global memory
    handle as it doesn't know which element to write into.  By passing NULL,
    the called routine allocates memory itself which we need to free after
    we've copied the RAT/VFP.
