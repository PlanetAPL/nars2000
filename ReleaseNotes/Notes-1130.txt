Build #1130 -- Version 0.4.0.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Pressing Ctrl-Break In Immediate Execution Mode

Directory trunk:

ERRMSG.C:
  Handle case where the incoming SIS ptr is NULL, indicating we should set []DM to ''.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Call <BreakMessage> every time we are about to execute []ALX, not just from non-immediate execution mode.
