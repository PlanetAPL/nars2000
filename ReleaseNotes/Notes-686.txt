------------------------------

* Display Axis Operator When Used With A UDFO

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Improve comments.
  Use common routine to display a variable within a function strand,
    and use it for numeric and character strands.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, display the axis operator when used with a UDFO.

PF_DTACKJOT.C:
  Improve comments.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include additional files and routines.

STRAND.C:
  Improve comments.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCopyFcn>, switch to using <lpToken> instead of <hGlbFcn>.
  In <YYCopyGlbFcn_PTB>, pass in a ptr to a token instead of the
    corresponding global memory handle so we can distinguish an
    axis array from a variable array.
