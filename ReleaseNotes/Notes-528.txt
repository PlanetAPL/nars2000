* Move Name Classes (Result Of []NC) To A Range That Doesn't Overlap
  Other Vendor's Use

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  Fix Bug:  The OBJNAME_xxx value for System Labels was set to OBJNAME_USR
    instead of OBJNAME_SYS.

NAMECLASS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix typo in comment.
  Move name classes for System Variables, System Functions, System
    Labels and Magic Functions to the 21+ range so as not to overlap
    other vendor's use.

QF_NC.C:
  Change comments about name class values.

QF_NL.C:
  Widen the bit bucket which holds the name class values to 64 bits in
    case the largest name class value increases.
  Move name classes for System Variables, System Functions, System
    Labels and Magic Functions to the 21+ range so as not to overlap
    other vendor's use.
  In <SysFnDydNL_EM_YY>, widen the nameclass bit bucket to 64 bits.
  In <SysFnDydNL_EM_YY>, check for valid range for the input.

SC_FNOV.C:
  Change <stNameType> from <UINT> to <NAME_TYPES> for a better view
    when debugging.
  In <CmdFNOV_EM>, when looping through the SYMENTRYs, omit Magic
    Functions and System Names except for System Labels.
  In <CmdFNOV_EM>, omit separate check for System and Magic Functions.
  In <CmdFNOV_EM>, allow for two digit nameclass values in the
    )NMS output.
  Optimize FOR stmt with <FillMemoryW>.
