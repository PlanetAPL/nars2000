Build #362 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <CalcArraySize>, add in one element to <ARRAY_CHAR> args so we
    always have a zero-terminated string.

QF_NL.C:
  Delete superfluous <* sizeof (APLCHAR)> as it's already done by
    <CalcArraySize>.

SC_COMMON.C:
  No need to add in an extra 1 to the NELM when allocating ARRAY_CHARs
    as <CalcArraySize> now does that automatically.

SC_WSID.C:
  Update copyright year.
  No need to add in an extra 1 to the NELM when allocating ARRAY_CHARs
    as <CalcArraySize> now does that automatically.

SYSVARS.C:
  In <ValidateCharVector_EM>, there's no need to copy right arg to a
    temp location as it's always zero-terminated.
  No need to add in an extra 1 to the NELM when allocating ARRAY_CHARs
    as <CalcArraySize> now does that automatically.
