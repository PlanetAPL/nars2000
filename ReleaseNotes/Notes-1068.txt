Build #1068 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Making Workspace Backup
# Define DEBUG Stmts To Catch Unsynchronized Vars

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  In <oprintfW>, <dprintfLW0>, and <dprintfWL9> the type of the
    temp vars needs to be sensitive to the 32- vs. 64-bit compiler.  This
    fails in the 64-bit DEBUG version only.

DEBUG.H:
  New file containing #defines, etc. for detecting unsynchronized vars.

EDITFCN.C
  Update copyright year.
  Check for unsynchronized vars.
  In <SyntaxColor>, allocate global memory for the Syntax Color indices instead of
    relying on synchronization of preallocated memory in <lpMemPTD->lpwszTemp>.

NAMECLASS.H:
  Improve comments.

PERTAB.H:
  Define bit to indicate whether or not <lpwszTemp> is in use (open) so as to
    help catch synchronization errors.
  Define wchar ptr to point to the <filename #linenum> of the place where
    <lpwszTemp> was last opened.

QF_CR.C:
QF_TF.C:
SC_COPY.C:
SC_IN.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
SC_OUT.C:
SC_SAVE.C:
SC_SI.C:
STRAND.C:
SYSVARS.C:
  Check for unsynchronized vars.

QF_NFNS.C:
  In <SysErrMsg>, <countof> instead of <strcountof> as the latter is off by one.

SCS_COMMON.C:
  In <MakeWorkspaceBackup> use high level <CopyFile> instead of low level <fopen/fread/fwrite/fclose>
    as the latter have shown themselves to fail on access issues.
