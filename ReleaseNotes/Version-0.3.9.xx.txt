Version 0.3.9.xx consists of the following Builds:


Build #1083 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Use More MPIR Data Types

Directory trunk:

MPFNS.C:
  Convert <unsigned long int> and <signed long int> when used in a <mpz_*>
    or <mpq_*> context to <mpir_ui> and <mpir_si> to match the types used
    in MPIR.


Build #1082 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Call ECM Function As Per Their Recommendation

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  Use parameters to ECM calls as per their README file.


Build #1081 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Describe New Download File Containing Multi-Precision Source

Directory trunk\htdocs:

FOOTER-MON.HTML:
FOOTER.HTML:
  Include GPL license logo in the footer.
  Change the footer from promoting OpenOffice to LibreOffice.

DISPLAY.C:
  Define #define stmts for formatting constants.
  Fix Bug:  In <FormatAplVfpFC>, the parameter <nDigits> was misinterpreted.
    This changes the display of VFP numbers to no longer use exponential notation
    to denote insufficient precision; instead we now use trailing underscores.

-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Making Workspace Backup
# Define DEBUG Stmts To Catch Unsynchronized Vars

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix Bug:  In <oprintfW>, <dprintfLW0>, and <dprintfWL9> the type of the
    temp vars needs to be sensitive to the 32- vs. 64-bit compiler.  This
    fails in the 64-bit DEBUG version only.

DEBUG.H:
  New file containing #defines, etc. for detecting unsynchronized vars.

EDITFCN.C
  Update copyright year.
  Check for unsynchronized vars.
  In <SyntaxColor>, allocate global memory for the Syntax Color indices instead of
    relying on synchronization of preallocated memory in <lpMemPTD->lpwszTemp>.

NAMECLASS.H:
  Improve comments.

PERTAB.H:
  Define bit to indicate whether or not <lpwszTemp> is in use (open) so as to
    help catch synchronization errors.
  Define wchar ptr to point to the <filename #linenum> of the place where
    <lpwszTemp> was last opened.

QF_CR.C:
QF_TF.C:
SC_COPY.C:
SC_IN.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
SC_OUT.C:
SC_SAVE.C:
SC_SI.C:
STRAND.C:
SYSVARS.C:
  Check for unsynchronized vars.

QF_NFNS.C:
  In <SysErrMsg>, <countof> instead of <strcountof> as the latter is off by one.

SCS_COMMON.C:
  In <MakeWorkspaceBackup> use high level <CopyFile> instead of low level <fopen/fread/fwrite/fclose>
    as the latter have shown themselves to fail on access issues.


Build #1067 -- Version 0.3.9.xx

  In <ArrayIndexRefLstImm_EM_YY>, remove ARRAY_RAT and ARRAY_VFP cases as they can never happen.

PF_IOTA.C:
  Rename <mpq_get_ctsa> to <mpq_get_sctsx> and <mpfr_get_ctsa> to <mpfr_get_sctsx> to better describe their function
    as using System []CT, and use <sx> suffix instead of <sa> to match that of the MPIR library for 64-bit integers.
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
  In <PrimFnDydIota_EM_YY>, get and pass []CT down to the various subroutines rather than getting it in each.
  Rename <PrimFnDydIotaIvI_EM> to <PrimFnDydIotaIvN_EM> to cover all right arg numeric cases.
  Rename <PrimFnDydIotaNvN_EM> to <PrimFnDydIotaFvN_EM> as it handles only right arg float cases.
  Improve comments.

  Fix bug in <PrimFnDydIotaVvN_EM> where in the <VvF> case the right arg is mistakenly converted to an integer.
  In <PrimFnDydIotaOther>, pass the proper function token to the Match function.
  Fix bug in dyadic iota where for everything but I vs. B/I/A/F/R/V and R vs. B/I/A/R, if we search
    for a number that occurs after a larger number that is within []CT of the
    searched for number, we miss it.  For example, 1 2 (3+1e{neg}10) 3 {iota} 3
    where []CT is 1e{neg}10.  After we find a match and have searched
    down through lower indices to GradeUp, the fix is then to search up through
    higher indices to GradeUp for values within []CT with lower argument indices.

Build #1066 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Nested vs. Simple Scalar

Directory trunk:

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
  In <PrimFnDydNestSiSc_EM>, Assert and allow global numerics along with other simple arrays.


Build #1065 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In Match

Directory trunk:

PF_EQUALUND.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Switch macro <VarArrayBaseToData> to <VarArrayDataFmBase> as it's simpler.
  In various places where we compare a float with another datatype directly, they should be compared within []CT.


Build #1064 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Use Parent Window Handle In All MessageBox Calls

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
EXCEPT.C:
INIFILE.C:
MACROS.H:
MAIN.C:
SAVEFCN.C:
SC_COPY.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
UPDATES.C:
  Use a parent window handle in all MessageBox calls so the MessageBox window
    closes when the app closes.


Build #1063 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Even More Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Omit double quote marks around the argument passed to <:subroutine> as they get in the way.


Build #1062 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* More Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPINIT.BAT:
  Use internal mechanism to show progress instead of using an external file.

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Use batch file processing for all .dep files instead of multiple calls to
    this batch file by <nmake> as the latter appears to run the batch file in
    multiple threads which causes a race condition where each batch file is
    appending to the output file at the same time.  This wasn't a problem until
    I switched to an SSD drive!

ECHODOT.BAT:
ECHODOT.PHP:
ECHODOT.TXT:
  Delete these files as they are no longer needed.

MAKEFILE.DEP:
  Update copyright year.
  Call <deptxt.bat> once with all filenames in the argument instead of multiple
    times on one filename.

MAKEFILE.IND:
  Update copyright year.
  Parameterize <nmake> as set by the caller so we call the same program at all levels.

MK32.BAT:
MKD32.BAT:
MK64.BAT:
MKD32.BAT:
MKD64.BAT:
MKN.BAT:
  Omit DOS-era reference to <NMAKER>.
  Use FOR loop instead of multiple lines to set a variable.


Build #1061 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPINIT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process.

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process, and on a fast system
    may trigger an error message saying that "The process cannot access the
    file because it is being used by another process.".

ECHODOT.TXT:
  A one-byte file containing a dot ".".  No trailing CR/LF is present so that
    typing the file from multiple calls spits out a series of dots all on one
    line until it wraps at the right edge of the CMD window.

VER.RC:
  Increment version # to 0.3.9.xx.
