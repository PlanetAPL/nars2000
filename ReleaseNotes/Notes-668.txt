Build #668 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Clear A Certain Flag To Avoid Confusion If the Array Is Copied

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <CopyArray_EM> when copying a var, be sure to clear
    the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag as it certainly doesn't apply
    to the result.

REFCNT.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <ChangeRefCntDir_PTB> when changing the RefCnt of
    a permanent var, be sure to clear the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag
    so it doesn't get copied to a copy of the var.
