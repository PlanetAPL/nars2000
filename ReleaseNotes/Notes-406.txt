Build #406 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

MAIN.C:
  In <MFWndProc>/<WM_SIZE>, run through all tabs resizing their MDI Client
    windows.
  Reorganize #defines/#undefs.

SESSMAN.C:
  Reorganize #defines/#undefs.
  Delete test for Status Window when calculating size of Debug vs. Session
    Manager windows as the Status Window has already been accounted for in
    the MDI Client client area.

TABCTRL.C:
  Delete commented out code as we don't use it.
  In <CreateNewTabInThread>, tell the Master Frame to resize itself so as
    to size the newly created MDI Client window.
