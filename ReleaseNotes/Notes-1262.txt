Build #1262 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug Accounting For Trains

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <IsFcnStrDirect>, if the argument is a function array and a Train,
    return TRUE so it is handled correctly by <MakeFcnStrand>.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYAlloc>, include comments on how to debug <YYResIsEmpty> memory leaks.
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, if the item is a Train count it as a single element as
    that's the way it is treated in <YYCountFcnGlb>.
