Build #416 -- Version 0.0.1.14
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  Fix Bug:  Handle more cases where we should indicate Precision Loss.

FMTSPEC.C:
  Allow single and double quote marks as text delimiters.
  In <fnSetModO>, handle specific value with a fractional part/
  Allow L Qualifier for A-format (code already there to support it,
    just didn't allow it).
  Allow Repetition Factor on X-format.

FMTSPEC.H:
  Rename <SYMSUB_E_CHAR> to <SYMSUB_EXPONENT_SEP> to better reflect
    its usage.

QF_FMT.C:
  Allow Repetition factor on X-format.
  Fix Bug:  When adding text for P- or Q-decorators, include zero
    in the comparison.
  Fix Bug:  Include Precision Loss character in Symbol Substitution
    test loop.
  Rename <SYMSUB_E_CHAR> to <SYMSUB_EXPONENT_SEP> better to reflect
    its usage.
  Fix Bug:  In <QFMT_SubstValue> when there's a match with a float
    value, the wrong variable had the offset applied to it (handled
    correctly for integer values).
