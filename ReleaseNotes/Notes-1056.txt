Build #1056 -- Version 0.3.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In DEBUG Version:  Untokenize Should Not Test Named Vars/Fcns/Ops

Directory trunk:

SC_LOAD.C:
  Use four-byte sscanf format string for four-byte var.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <Untokenize>, don't test named vars/fcns/ops in DEBUG version as they need not be defined.
