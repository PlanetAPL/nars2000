Build #956 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Reorder []DR Constants

Directory trunk:

QF_DR.C:
  Move []DR constants to their own header file.
  Reorder []DR constants so that all numeric types are adjacent.
  Remove bit size from 32- vs. 64-bit HETERO/NESTED/RATIONAL/VFP constants
    as it unnecessarily complicates the function.
  Allow for COMPLEX/QUATERNION/OCTONION numbers whose coefficients may all be
    any of INTEGER, FLOAT, RATIONAL, or VFP.

QF_DR.H:
  New file containing []DR constants.
