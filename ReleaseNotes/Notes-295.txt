Build #295 -- Version 0.0.0.18810
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
  Temporarily avoid displaying debug messages.

DFNHDR.Y:
  Rename <DbgMsgW2> to <DbgMsgWP> and redefine the default behavior.

DISPDBG.C:
  Widen debug messages to use <DbgMsgW> in a move towards Unicode everywhere.

DISPLAY.C:
EDITFCN.C:
IMMEXEC.C:
MAIN.C:
YYFNS.C:
  Widen debug messages to use <DbgMsgW> in a move towards Unicode everywhere.

EXCEPT.C:
  Re-word leading text in Crash Control Window.
  Display the instruction stream.

EXCEDFN.C:
  Omit <DisplayFcnLine> in non-DEBUG versions.
  Use <DbgMsgW2> instead of <DbgMsgW> to avoid display of debug messages.

EXECMFN.C:
PF_COMMA.C:
PO_DOT.C:
QF_UCS.C:
SC_COPY.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.

MACROS.H:
  Define <DbgMsgW2> as controlled by the value of <gDbgLvl> to reduce debug messages.
  Use <nop> in <Assert> to allow easier continuation after error.
  Change <GetPtrTypeXXX> macro in DEBUG version to check for NULL ptr.
  Define <IsImmBool> macro to round out the set.

MAKEPRO.C:
  Handle empty output file.

PARSE.Y:
  Rename <DbgMsgW2> to <DbgMsgWP> and redefine the default behavior.
  Widen debug messages to use <DbgMsgW> in a move towards Unicode everywhere.

PF_EPSILON.C:
PO_DIERESIS.C:
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.
  Define <ERROR_EXIT> label and free result if allocated.

PF_INDEX.C:
PF_RSHOE.C:
PF_SQUAD.C:
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.
  Rename <ArrayIndexReplace> to <ArrayIndexReplace_EM> to reflect that
    it may return after signalling an error message.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Speed up monadic and dyadic reduction by determining the result storage type
    up front and blowing up only if necessary.  This avoids stressing the symbol
    table too much thus risking a SYMBOL TABLE FULL error message.
  Fix bug:  Dyadic reduction saves its values into the result in the wrong order
    if the reduction is not along the last coordinate.
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.

PO_SLOPE.C:
  Speed up monadic scan by determining the result storage type
    up front and blowing up only if necessary.  This avoids stressing the symbol
    table too much thus risking a SYMBOL TABLE FULL error message.
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Improve comments.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Use macro for type testing.

SESSMAN.C:
  Widen debug messages to use <DbgMsgW> in a move towards Unicode everywhere.
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more addresses for debugging purposes.

STRAND.C:
  In <MakeList_EM_YY>, move call to <YYAlloc> to after all errors are detected.
  In <MakeList_EM_YY>, fill the result with <PTR_REUSED> in case we fail part way through.

SYMTAB.C:
  Comment out <MakePermSymEntry_EM> as it not used.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Widen debug messages to use <DbgMsgW> in a move towards Unicode everywhere.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  Improve comments.
  Fix bug:  Check return value from functions that create a Symbol Table Entry.
