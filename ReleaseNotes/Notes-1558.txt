Build #1558 -- Version 0.4.17.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Function Editor When Editing A Local Function And Saving Back To Wrong SI Level

Directory trunk:

AFOFNS.C:
QF_FX.C:
QF_TF.C:
SC_INASCII.C:
SC_LOAD.C:
  Identify the caller of <SaveFunctionCom> for later use.

FH_PARSE.H:
FH_PARSE.Y:
FH_PROC.C:
  Define new fields to track the token offset in <hGlbTknHdr> of the function name.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Identify the caller of <SaveFunctionCom> for later use.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <SaveFunctionCom> after calling <ParseFcnHeader>, if called from FE find the next SI level in which
    a given name is localized and when found change the LPSYMENTRY into the header tokens and incoming SYMENTRY.

SAVEFCN.H:
  Define fields to track caller of <SaveFunctionCom>.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Remove parens around {del} in <fnDelDone> as they are unnecessary and also mess up the above tracking of the function name token.
