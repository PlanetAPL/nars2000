Build #610 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Reference Count For Trains Incorrect

Directory trunk:

DATATYPE.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new flag in <FCNARRAY_HEADER>.
  Define variable/function/operator header ptrs union.

DISPDBG.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <DisplayGlobals>, surround the function array with parens unless
    it's a Train.
  Fix Bug:  The display of a Train one of whose elements is a derived
    function (hence, multiple element), displays the first element only.
  In <DisplayFcnSub> for Function Arrays, use <DisplayFcnMem> to display
    rather than <DisplayFcnSub> so as to handle Trains.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbPtrs_LOCK>, handle <TKT_FCNIMMED> case.

MAKEPRO.PHP:
  Improve comments.
  Fix prototype stmts.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Ensure all <YYFree>s are followed by setting the ptr to NULL.
  When calling <MakeFcnStrand>/<PushFcnStrand> when working with
    Trains set the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag so as not to introduce a
    memory leak when the Train goes through its final call to
    <MakeFcnStrand> as the <LeftOper> is instantiated.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <CopyArray_EM> for Function Arrays, increment the top level
    reference count as that's where Trains come in.
  Define <IsTknTypeFcnOpr> to determine if a token type is a fcn/opr.
  Rename <SetVarArraySRCIFlag> to <SetVFOArraySRCIFlag> to encompass
    fcn/opr as well as var and rename vars within the new function to
    reflect the dual meaning.
  Rename <ClrVarArraySRCIFlag> to <ClrVFOArraySRCIFlag> for the same
    reasons as above.

REFCNT.C:
  Update copyright year.
  In <ChangeRefCntDir_PTB>, check for and handle the <SkipRefCntIncr>
    flag for function arrays, too.

STRAND.C:
  Rename <ClrVarArraySRCIFlag> to <ClrVFOArraySRCIFlag>.
  Improve comments.
