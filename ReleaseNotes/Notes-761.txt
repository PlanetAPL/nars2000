Build #761 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Implement []EC

Directory trunk:

COMPRO.H:
  Include prototype file for []EC.

DATATYPE.H:
  Define PERMNDX_xxx values for constant matrices (0 x 0 and 3 x 0).

ERRMSG.C:
  In <BreakMessage>, save the event type.
  Improve comments.
  In <ErrorMessageDirect>, address the parent error control SIS header
  In <GetPtrQuadEM>, address the parent error control SIS header
    of the next one up that's not a fcn, op1, op2, or errctrl and return
    a ptr to hGlbQuadEM in that or the global one in PerTabData global
    memory.
  Replace <DFNTYPE_QUADEA> with <DFNTYPE_ERRCTRL> to catch the []EC
    case, too.
  If there's no SIS header, save the value of []EM in the PerTabData struc.

EVENTTYPES.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Convert #defines to an enum so they show up as text in the debugger.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, if about to suspend and there's a []EA/[]EC
    error control in effect, exit the function.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define global memory handles for constant matrices (0 x 0 and 3 x 0).

FH_PARSE.H:
  Replace <DFNTYPE_QUADEA> with <DFNTYPE_ERRCTRL> to catch the []EC
    case, too.

GOTO.C:
  In <GotoLine_EM>, avoid checking the first element of an empty
    simple array.
  In <GotoLine_EM>, save the value of the {goto} target if we're
    executing under []EC, and skip setting the next stmt # as we're
    about to abandon this SIS level.
  Define new routine to save the {goto} target if we're executing
    under []EC.

HEADERS.H:
  Move <eventtypes.h> up to before <pertab.h> as the latter header
    uses an enum name defined in the former header.

MAKEFILE.INC:
MAKEFILE.SRC:
NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Include name of new file for []EC.

PERTAB.H:
  Define PerTabData globals for []EM and []ET which previously had no
    global value due to misreading the spec.

PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCommon_EM_YY>, include additional parameter to
    pass back the <exitType> of the call to <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse>.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  In <StmtSing:ArrValu> set explicit <EXITTYPE_NOVALUE> for that case, and
    <EXITTYPE_NODISPLAY> or <EXITTYPE_DISPLAY> depending upon the NoDisplay flag.
  In <StmtSing:GOTO>, don't set the <RESETFLAG_xxx> if executing under []EC
    as that only confuses later code.
  In <ParseLine>, with <EXITTYPE_RESET_ONE_INIT> if the first non-EXEC SIS
    header up the line is from []EC, don't set the <RESETFLAG_xxx>
    as that only confuses later code.
  In <ParseLine> if there's an error to be signalled skip it if we're
    executing under []EA/[]EC as the error is to be passed up to the
    error control SIS header.
  In <ArrExprCheckCaller>,  save the Execute result if there's a error
    control parent active.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <FillSISNxt>, if the immediately preceding SIS header is an error
    control, set the ptr to it in the current SIS header, and pass on
    down any previous error control headers.

QF_EA.C:
  Replace <DFNTYPE_QUADEA> with <DFNTYPE_ERRCTRL> to catch the []EC
    case, too.
  In <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCommon_EM_YY>, include additional parameter to
    pass back the <exitType> of the call to <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCSPLParse>.

QF_EC.C:
QF_EC.H:
  New files to implement []EC.

QF_EM.C:
  In <SysFnEM_EM_YY>, return either the SIS header value or the global
    value in the PerTabData struc.

QF_ES.C:
  Omit <eventypes.h> as it's include in <headers.h>.

QF_ET.C:
  Replace <DFNTYPE_QUADEA> with <DFNTYPE_ERRCTRL> to catch the []EC
    case, too.
  In <SetEventTypeMessage> don't return a result as no one uses it.
  In <SetEventTypeMessage>, save the <EventType> in either the
    appropriate SIS header or the global value in the PerTabData struc.

SC_IN.C:
  In <TransferInverseArr2_EM>, handle <EXITTYPE_DISPLAY> now allowed to be
    returned from <ParseLine> to make []EC work.

SC_SI.C:
  Fix typo in comments.

SIS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define ptr to hold the HGLOBAL of the {goto} target when executing
    under []EC.
  Define bit field to indicate we're executing under []EC.
  Define ptr to error control header (if any).

SYSVARS.C:
  Define entries for []EC as a new system function.
  In <MakePermVars>, allocate space for a 0 by 0 Boolean matrix
    to be used in []EC[2].
  Rename <hGlbQuadEM> to <hGlb3by0> to reflect its value.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Define new function to translate from EXIT_TYPES to []EC[0] return codes.
