Build #542 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  The Identity Element For Inner Product Was Fixed At Zero

Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Define var for constant (all zero) <PRIMFLAGS> for use when
    <GetPrimFlagsPtr> is NULL.
  Define and use struct for primitive scalar dyadic function
    identity elements.

INITDATA.C:
  Use struct for primitive scalar dyadic function identity
    elements.

PO_DOT.C:
  Return identity element when reducing an empty intermediate result.
  Limit inner product to cases where the inner dimensions are equal.
  Handle UDFO reduction of empty intermediate result by calling the UDFO
    at []IDENTITY.
  Handle catenate reduction of empty intermediate result specially.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Reorganize the code in <PrimOpMonSlashCommon_EM_YY> to match that
    of <PrimOpDydDotCommon_EM_YY>.
  Pass additional parameters to <PrimOpMonSlashScalar_EM_YY> so they
    don't need to be computed inside that function.
  Use struct for primitive scalar dyadic function identity
    elements.

PO_SLOPE.C:
  Reorganize the code in <PrimOpMonSlashCommon_EM_YY> to match that
    of <PrimOpDydDotCommon_EM_YY>.
  Pass additional parameters to <PrimOpMonSlashScalar_EM_YY> so they
    don't need to be computed inside that function.
