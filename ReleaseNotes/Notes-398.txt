Build #398 -- Version 0.0.1.12
------------------------------

Directory trunk:

EXECDFN.C:
  Reorganize code.
  In <UnlocalizeSTEs>, include <NAMETYPE_OP3> as possible name type
    of a function to unlocalize.
  Fix bug:  If we're localizing a system var which has a global
    memory handle, increment its reference count as we retain the global
    value over localization.
