Build #323 -- Version 0.0.0.21985
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
  Fix Bug:  Handle case of <(a){is}10 20> which should assign the whole
    expression to <a>.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Ensure the bundled font gets copied to the target directory.

PF_INDEX.C:
  In <ArrayIndexSetSingLst_EM>, include <TKT_VARIMMED> along with <TKT_LSTIMMED>
    to accommodate Selective Assignment (whenever we get it right).

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Fix Bug:  In <SimpExpr:SelectSpec{is}ArrExpr>, the case of <(a b){is}ArrExpr> was
    not handled correctly.  Also, the wrong model was used for Selective Specification
    so it is now removed until I figure it out.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <CopyGlbAsType_EM>, handle result type of nested for explosion
    in index assignment of a simple array to a nested array.  In other words,
    a{is}'abcd' {diamond} a[1]{is}{enclose}10 20 30
    fails due to this bug.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Withdraw Selective Assignment as I used the wrong model.
  Withdraw []AF as per IBM suggestion.
