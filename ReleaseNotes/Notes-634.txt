Build #634 -- Version 0.0.2.9
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Allow Certain Derived Functions To Be Used With Monadic Ops

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Fix Bug:  Split out monadic left operands from the dyadics so as to
    allow <Drv1Func>/<Drv3Func>/<Drv4Func>s to be used as the operand
    to a monadic operator.
  Improve comments.
  Split out <(error)>/<(Drv1Func)>/<(Drv5Func)> from <LeftOper> and
    move them into <ParenFunc>.
