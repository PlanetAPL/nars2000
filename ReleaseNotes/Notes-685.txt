Build #685 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Allow A Var In Parens As A Left Or Right Operand To An Operator

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Generalize the left and right operand values as variables from strands
    to variables surrounded by parens.
  In <LookbehindOp>, return FALSE for ambiguous operators so as to allow
    1 2 3/4 5 6.
  In <pl_yylex> upon encountering a right paren surrounding a variable,
    check for a monadic or dyadic operator as the previous token as well
    as for a dyadic operator as the next token after the closing left
    paren.
