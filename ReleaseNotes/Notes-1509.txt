* Fix Bug In Ctrl-Break Display And Subsequent )RESET

Directory trunk:

ERRMSG.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  In <BreakMessage>, omit leading ellipsis from text.
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.
  In <ErrorMessageDirect>, allow line text ptr to be NULL to indicate do not create []DM and []EM.

EXCEPT.C:
PRIMFNS.C:
SC_SI.C:
SIS.H:
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecDfnGlb_EM_YY>, change Assert stmt to allow axes ptr to be the same.
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, display function name/line # on []STOP only.
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY> with RESETFLAG_ALL, return NULL not NoValue.

GOTO.C:
  In <GotoLine_EM>, set var in case the value is immediate.
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.

PARSELINE.C:
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.
  In <ParseLine>, note whether or not <BreakMessage> has been called so we don't overwrite []DM/[]EM.

  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Change one-bit struc names to have a leading 'b'.
