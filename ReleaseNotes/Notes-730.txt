Build #730 -- Version 0.0.2.18
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Disclose of (say) 'x' ({zilde}) 'y' Returns An Invalid Array (Empty Heterogeneous)

Directory trunk:

PF_RSHOE.C:
  Include missing Assertion on the incoming function.
  Handle {disclose}'x' ({zilde}) 3 differently from
         {disclose} 3  ({zilde}) 'x' in that while they
    are both 3 by 0 matrices, their prototypes differ.
  Fix Bug:  If the result is empty heterogeneous, change
    it to either char or numeric depending upon the first
    non-empty (simple scalar) item.
