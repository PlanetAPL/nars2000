Build #287 -- Version 0.0.0.18444
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  Define function rather than macro for <IsGlbPtr> so we can trap
    errors (such as when using the result of GetClipboardData
    (which can't be trusted) after copying data from MS Word.

DEBUG.C:
  Use wide char routines for <GetMessage> and <DispatchMessage> as
    we're using Unicode windows.

EDITFCN.C:
  In <CopyGlbMemory>, use <IsGlbPtr> on incoming handle instead of
    just checking for non-zero.
  In <PasteAPLChars>, skip setting clipboard data for our format or
    invalid formats.

EXTERNS.H:
  Rename <szOpenFile> (unused) to <wszLoadFile> to hold the workspace
    name on the command line.

MACROS.H:
  Switch <IsGlbPtr> from macro to function.

MAIN.C:
  Improve comments.
  At startup, load the workspace on the command line (if present) or
    a CLEAR WS.
  In <ParseCommandLine>, check for initial workspace name and save it.
  Use wide char routines for <GetMessage> and <DispatchMessage> as
    we're using Unicode windows.

MAIN.H:
  Define length of <WS_WKSEXT>.

MAKEFILE.W32:
MAKEFILE.W64:
  Reorganize code.
  Define and use target for "C:\Program Files\NARS2000\W32\NARS2000.EXE".
  Define and use target for PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expression library).
  Comment out PRO target from ALL so we don't automatically generate
    .pro files and thus don't always trigger a full build in Visual Studio.
  Make changes in <makepro> actions to match changes in the program.
  Use <copy> command instead of <xc> to make usage more general.

MAKEPRO.C:
  Prepare for PCRE usage.
  Split out source file from the switches so we can compare the new and old
    .pro files.

SC_COPY.C:
SC_DROP.C:
  Change from <WKSEXT> to <WS_WKSEXT>.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Change from <WKSEXT> to <WS_WKSEXT>.
  In <LoadWorkspace_EM>, allow incoming handle to be NULL to indicate
    loading a "CLEAR WS".
  Improve comments.
  Fix bug:  The value of <uMaxSize> passed down to <SF_ReadLineLW>
    and <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM> (when loaded through <LoadWsGlbVarConv>)
    was incorrect.

SC_SAVE.C:
  Change from <WKSEXT> to <WS_WKSEXT>.
  Strip off leading/trailing double-quote from workspace name on the
    command line.
  In <MakeWorkspaceNameCanonical>, strip off trailing <WS_WKSEXT> (if present).
  Use <WS_WKSEXT_LEN> instead of longer calculation.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc>, define <lResult> as return value from <WM_CREATE>.
  In <SMWndProc>, move initial load message display to precede call to
    <LoadWorkspace_EM> as that might display a message itself (WS NOT FOUND
    or SAVED ...).
  In <SMWndProc>, if the load of the command line workspace fails (WS NOT FOUND?),
    load a CLEAR WS instead.
  In <SMWndProc>, before returning from <WM_CREATE> free the global
    memory handle for the workspace name instead of in <CreateNewTabInThread>.

TABCTRL.C:
  Move tab color of Crimson to the end.
  Improve comments.
  Use wide char routines for <GetMessage> and <DispatchMessage> as
    we're using Unicode windows.
  Omit free of global memory handle for the workspace name as it's now freed in
    <SMWndProc> at the end of <WM_CREATE>.

UNITRANSTAB.H:
  Fix bug in translation of {eaualunderbar}.


Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Define and use new routines to handle <Ctrl-home> and <Ctrl-end> to do the CUA thing.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

CONTRIBUTORS-MENU.HTML:
INDEX-LEFT.HTML:
INDEX-MENU.HTML:
LICENSE-MENU.HTML;
  Switch from forums to groups.

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Include mention of large workspace size.
  Make wording clearer.
  Switch from forums to groups.


Directory trunk\htdocs\download:

DOWNLOAD-MENU.HTML:
  Switch from forums to groups.
