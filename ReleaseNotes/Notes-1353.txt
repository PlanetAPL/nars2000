Build #1353 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

Directory trunk:

FREE.C:
  In <FreeResultSub>, handle additional token <TKT_EOL> which may occur during a SYNTAX ERROR due to a missing left operand.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetPrototypeFcnPtr>, handle additional tokens for mop{each}{zilde}, etc., named and unnamed, monadic or dyadic, and AFO. Example: []nuntie{each}{zilde}.

PARSELINE.C:
  Improve comments.
  In <pl_yylexCOM>, call <TranslateDfnTypeToSOType> as needed so as to handle the niladic case.

PARSELINE.H:
  Handle right brace bindings just like right brackets and parentheses.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <CheckConstantCopyLoad>, simplify the code by using <TranslateDfnTypeToSOType>.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Define <TranslateDfnTypeToSOType> to translate a <DFN_HEADER> ptr to a <tkSynObj> ensuring that the niladic case is always handled.
