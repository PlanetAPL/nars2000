Build #1052 -- Version 0.3.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Reading []RL From A Workspace File
* Change the Primitive Root For []RL

Directory trunk:

INIFILE.C:
  When reading the value of []RL, use the <StringW> version of
    <GetPrivateProfileXXX> instead of the <IntW> version as the latter
    doesn't support 64-bit integers.

SYSVARS.H:
  Change the value of []RL in a clear ws to a larger primitive root
    (greater than (-1+2*61)*2r3) for better results.
  Define the above value as a wide string, too, for use in <inifile.c>.
