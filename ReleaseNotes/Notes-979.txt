Build #979 -- Version 0.3.7.xx
------------------------------

* Fix Bug On WinXP With Workspace, Edit, and Objects Toolbars

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Define local Windows message akin to WM_MOUSELEAVE.

REBAR.C:
  Use local MYWM_MOUSELEAVE message so we don't confuse the toolbar
    as to whether the mouse has left the window.
  Remove calls to <SetCapture> and <ReleaseCapture> as WinXP doesn't
    handle them well.

WCOM.BAT:
  Include the parent <qdebug> directory in the PATH so we can pick
    up QDEBUG32.DLL.
