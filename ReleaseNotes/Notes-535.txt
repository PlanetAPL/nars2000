Build #535 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Unlocalize []IO From The []VR Magic Function

Directory trunk:

EXECMFN.C:
  After initializing the hash and symbol tables for []VR, set the
    value of []IO to zero so we don't have to do it every time in
    the magic function.

QF_VR.C:
  In the magic function for []VR, remove all references to []IO
    as it is already localized as part of the hash and symbol tables
    and initialized to zero when the hash and symbol tables are first
    created.
