Build #289 -- Version 0.0.0.18558
---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DFNHDR.Y:
  Fix typos.

EXCEPT.C:
  Include instructions on how to copy all the text to the clipboard.

PARSE.Y:
  Note in debug message display whether or not we're within a LookAhead.
  Fix bug:  In terminal <StrandInst> rule <error StrandRec>, instantiate the
    strand so we can free its associated storage.  Calling <FreeResult> on
    the <StrandRec> token accomplishes nothing.
  Fix bug:  Handle error conditions inside brackets at point of usage
    rather than definition.  That way, we avoid an infinite loop.  Nice touch.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Provide valid default timestamps for Creation and Last Modification times in case
    the workspace is missing those values.
