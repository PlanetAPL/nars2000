Build #1606 -- Version 0.4.18.xx
--------------------------------

* Handle Syntax: (A A A) F IDX SPA
* Handle Syntax:  A[A] F MOP A
* Handle Syntax:  A[A] F MOP SPA

Directory trunk:

PARSELINE.C:
  Define reduction for "LNR ISPA" as the same as "LNR SPA".
  Define reduction for "NDX SPA" as the same as "IDX SPA".
  Define reduction for "F ISPA" as the same as "F SPA".
  Define macro to extract SynObj of the right stack +3.
  When checking for the "IDX" -> "NDX" translation, be sure to include the
    trailing SPA so we know it's a NAM assignment.
  Rename ADX to NDX to better suggest that this is a Name Index.
  Restore <GetLftSynObj> as we need the special treatment in it.
  Comment out (#if FALSE/#endif) <GetLftToken> as we no longer need it.
  Omit <lpYYRht0> and <lptkRht0> as it always points to an empty entry.
  Handle more syntax cases of modified assignment.

PARSELINE.H:
  Make the binding strength of 'F ISPA' the same as 'F SPA'.
  Lower the binding strength of 'IDX SPA' to xIDX-1 so that 'IDX IDX SPA' -> IDX SPA.
  Lower the binding strength of 'NAM IDX' to xIDX-2 so that 'NAM IDX IDX SPA' -> 'NAM IDX SPA'
  Make the binding strength of 'LNR ISPA' the same as 'LNR SPA'.
  Lower the binding strength of 'ADX SPA' to xIDX-1 so that 'NAM ADX SPA' -> NAM ISPA.
  Define reduction for 'F ISPA' to ISPA.
  Define reduction for 'LNR ISPA' to A.

STARTADDR.H:
  Put <GetLstSynObj> back in and comment out <GetLftToken> as the need for that change
    was solved in <pl_yyLexCOM> with better detection of Name Assignment.

SYNOBJ.H:
  Rename ADX to NDX to better suggest that this is a Name Index.
