---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

BISON.RULES:
  Make command line sensitive to environment var
    rather than hard-coded path and filename.

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Use explicit size rather than erroneous <countof>
    or <strlengthof>.

DEFINES.H:
  Use <strcountof> instead of <sizeof (...) / sizeof (...)>.
  Increment the copyright year.
  Define copyright strings for use in other constants.

EDITFCN.C:
MACROS.H:
SC_ERASE.C:
VER.C:
  Rename <strlengthof> to <strcountof>.

EXCEPT.C:
  Revise copyright message to refer to Forum rather than
    mailing list.
  Use <WS_APPEND_DEBUG> instead of equivalent but more
    verbose code.

MAIN.C:
  Rename <strlengthof> to <strcountof>.
  Handle case where default APL font is not present in the
    program directory.

MAIN.RC:
  Increment the copyright year.

MAKEFILE.DEP:
  White space changes only.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Delete <INITIAL_C> target as it forces a link whether
    it is needed or not.
  When creating <dep.txt>, ensure the required directories
    are present.

MAKEFILE.PRO:
  Defines <.SUFFIXES:> so the .y rules are acted upon.
  Make command line sensitive to environment var
    rather than hard-coded path and filename.

MAKEFILE.W32:
  The Resource Compiler si actually in the SDK rather
    than the C Compiler.

MAKEFILE.W64:
  Define _WIN64 for 64-bit compiles.
  The Resource Compiler si actually in the SDK rather
    than the C Compiler.

NARS2000.VCPROJ:
  Delete <WineHQ.rules> and <WineHQ.bat> as they are
    no longer needed.
  Define local Additional Include Directories instead
    of putting them in the global settings.
  Define <_X86_> so as to pick up the <CONTEXT> struct.
  Define a Post-Build Event to copy the default APL font
    to the $(OutDir) as it is needed to run the program.
  Define local Additional Include Directories for compiling
    <editctrl.c> so as to pick up the right headers.
  Ignore Standard Include Path for <editctrl.c> as it
    has its own headers.

SESSMAN.C:
  Use previously defined copyright strings instead of
    hard-coded constants.

SYMTAB.C:
  Define string length argument to <HshTabLookupNameHash>
    because when used in <SymbolNameToChar> we need to
    terminate the incoming string after a certain point
    which we can't do when the inomciong string is a constant
    and Data Protection is on in the CPU.

SYMTAB.H:
  White space changes only.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Use <countof> instead of incorrect <strlengthof>.

VER.RC:
  Comment out defines that are defined elsewhere (DEFINES.H).

Directory trunk\WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Undefine <WM_CTLCOLOR> as it is defined (with the
    same value) in both <windowsx.h> and <winuser.h> thus
    avoiding an error because of the duplicate defines.

WINEHQ.BAT:
  Delete file no longer needed.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

CONTRIBUTORS-MENU.HTML:
INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
