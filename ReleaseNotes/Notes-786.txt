* Fix Bug:  Set Owner Of ChooseFont Dialog To Avoid Problems

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  The owner listed in the ChooseFontW struc for the various fonts must be
    changed to that of the Fonts property page so that the Customize dialog
    can't be closed with the ChooseFontW dialog open.
  Use <TTN_GETDISPINFOW> consistently instead of <TTN_NEEDTEXTW>.
  In <TTN_GETDISPINFOW:>, if the <TOOLINFOW> struc used <TTF_IDISHWND>, we must
    convert the <idCtl> to its corresponding <CtrlID>.

MAIN.C:
  Use <TTN_GETDISPINFOW> consistently instead of <TTN_NEEDTEXTW>.
  Now that the Customize dialog is modeless, we must check for it already being
    open and disallow a second copy.

WEBCOLORS.C:
  Use <TTN_GETDISPINFOW> consistently instead of <TTN_NEEDTEXTW>.
