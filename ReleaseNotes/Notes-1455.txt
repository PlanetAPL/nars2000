Build #1455 -- Version 0.4.13.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In []EC R If Error Executing R
* Include "Hdr" In Name Of Result Of <MyGlobalLock>

Directory trunk:

QF_EC.C:
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <SysFnMonEC_EM_YY>, after executing the right arg, clear the <ExitType> in the caller's <plLocalVars>.
    Without this fix, the function that calls []EC suspends.
