---------------------------------

Directory trunk:

DEBUG.C:
IMMEXEC.C:
MAIN.C:
PARSE.Y:
PERTAB.H:
SC_LOAD.C:
SYMTAB.C:
TABCTRL.C:
  Widen string passed to <CheckException>, <MySetException>, and <lpMemPTD->ExceptionText>.

INIFILE.C:
  Fix typos in comment.
  If reading in []IC from <nars2000.ini> and the incoming value is the previous default,
    substitute the current default.

EXCEPT.C:
  Save context & exceptions records from a crash to be reported on later.
  Widen string passed to <CheckException>, <MySetException>, and <lpMemPTD->ExceptionText>.
  Display registers in Crash Control window.

EXECDFN.C:
  Fix bug:  Unlocalize SYMENTRYs in the reverse order in which they were localized
    so that duplicate names in the header (Z{is}FOO Z) are handled correctly.

EXTERNS.H:
  Include one more Indeterminate case:  N * _  where N < -1.  The indeterminate is that,
    although the result is _, we don't know the sign as _ is neither/both odd nor/and even.
    The default behavior is DOMAIN ERROR.  Because this is early in the picture for []IC,
    I inserted the new value into the middle of the integer vector to be near the other
    indeterminate involving exponentiation.  After release, all new values must be appended
    to the previous values.

PF_STAR.C:
  Implement integer exponentiation to return an integer if at all possible.  This involves
    changing the storage algorithm for dyadic star to allow the result to be Boolean or
    Integer if the args are both Boolean, or otherwise simple Integer.  This requires two
    new routines for the BisBvB and IisIvI cases.  The former was previously handled
    (incorrectly) by <PrimFnDydRightCaretUnderbarBisBvB>.  I say incorrectly, because it
    didn't catch the 0*0 case as subject to []IC.  The new routines in this module handle
    all those cases, as well as try to produce a Boolean or Integer result if possible.

PF_UTACK.C:
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
  Widen string passed to <CheckException>, <MySetException>, and <lpMemPTD->ExceptionText>.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <PrimScalarFnDydAllocate_EM>, ensure that *lphGlbRes is set under all circumstances.
  Improve comments.
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 whenever Boolean.
  Widen string passed to <CheckException>, <MySetException>, and <lpMemPTD->ExceptionText>.
  In various routines where we can blow up from Boolean to Float, pass down enough
    information to all the subroutines so as to allow a call to <PrimScalarFnDydAllocate_EM>.
  Ensure all error returns go through ERROR_EXIT so we can unlock memory as necessary.

SC_SAVE.C:
  If the workspace is being saved into the default location "%APPDATA%\NARS2000\workspaces",
    omit the leading portion of the workspace name in the " SAVED " message.
