Build #1239 -- Version 0.4.7.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Bracket Indexing

Directory trunk:

PF_INDEX.C:
  In <ArrayIndexRef_EM_YY>, allow items of the list arg to be scalars as well as vectors.
    This allows bracket indexing to be more like {pick}{each]{enclose}.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Use a more specific target as the link for "Extra APL Glyphs".
