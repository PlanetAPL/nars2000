Build #1317 -- Version 0.4.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When No CRASHRPT.DLL

Directory trunk:

COMMON.C:
  Define a function to do sprintfW and check for buffer overwrite.

MAIN.C:
  In <WinMain>, if there is no <CRASHRPT.DLL> in the same directory as the .exe,
    a message is displayed which uses a buffer that is too short, thus overwriting
    other data on the stack.  Use a longer buffer as well as a function to check the
    buffer size.
