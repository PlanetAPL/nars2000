-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Use Matrix Inverse Instead Of Matrix Divide In Magic Function For Overdetermined Rational Matrix

Directory trunk:

PF_DOMINO.C:
  The magic function for inverting overdetermined rational matrices
    must use the matrix inverse form instead of matrix divide as
    the version of FLINT we moved back to doesn't solve the system
    of equations.

REBAR.C:
  Include non-multiset definition for Subset and Superset tooltips.
