* Fix Bug:  Rank Operator Fails To Process The Prototype In The Result

Directory trunk:

PO_DIJOT.C:
  Fix Bug:  If the result from the Rank Operator is empty, we fail
    to process the prototype when calculating the minimum/maximum
    ranks before deciding whether or not to call the Conforming
    Disclose magic function.
  Fix Bug:  Both the monadic and dyadic magic functions failed to
    setup the rank vector arguments when called at []PRO.
