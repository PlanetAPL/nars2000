Build #1242 -- Version 0.4.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Race Condition Bug When Erasing a Native File

Directory trunk:

QF_NFNS.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Factor out <CloseHandle> from inside <NfnsRleaseOneResource> inside <NfnsReleaseResources>
    so as to be able to delete file while the ptr to the filename is still valid.
  In <NfnsReleasseOneResource>, test for validity before closing/freeing the resource.
  In <NfnsEraseRenameResize_EM> when erasing a native file,
    the unlock tests at the end of the subroutine must test for
    the presence of the global memory handle.
  In <NfnsErase>, close the handle, delete the file, and then release the resources.
