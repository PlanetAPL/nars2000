Build #514-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Wrong error line displayed under certain cirumstances.

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  Before calling EM_GETLINE, get the exact line length as sometimes
    W doesn't return the line when the length is -1 and gives no error.
  Delete window handle argument from <LPERRHANDFN>, <Errorhandler>,
    <ErrorMessageDirect>, and related functions as it is unneeded.

ERRMSG.C:
EXTERNS.H:
PL_PARSE.Y:
  Delete window handle argument from <LPERRHANDFN>, <Errorhandler>,
    <ErrorMessageDirect>, and related functions as it is unneeded.

IMMEXEC.C:
  Fix Bug:  When an immediate execution mode expression signals an
    error during tokenization while a user-defined function/operator
    is suspended, the SI stack hasn't been setup as yet, and so the
    error message includes the suspended function name and line
    instead of the immediate execution line which actually signalled
    the error.
  Delete window handle argument from <LPERRHANDFN>, <Errorhandler>,
    <ErrorMessageDirect>, and related functions as it is unneeded.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Before calling EM_GETLINE, get the exact line length as sometimes
    W doesn't return the line when the length is -1 and gives no error.
  Delete window handle argument from <LPERRHANDFN>, <Errorhandler>,
    <ErrorMessageDirect>, and related functions as it is unneeded.
