Build #536 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Implement {jot} As An Operand To Monadic and Dyadic Operators

Directory trunk:

DISPDBG.C:
  Define entry for new token TKT_FILLJOT.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecDfnOprGlb_EM_YY>, if the left or right operand is FILLJOT,
    leave the operand undefined.
  In <UninitOprSTEs>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  In <UninitOprSTEs>, check for NOVALUE before decrementing a refcnt.

FREE.C:
  In <FreeResultSub>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  In <FreeResultGlobalFcn>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.

MACROS.H:
  Define macro for detecting FILLJOT.

PL_PARSE.PROTO:
  In <LookaheadAdjacent>, define additional Boolean argument
    to indicate whether or not to look beyond a {jot}.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Define new token FILLJOT returned from <pl_yylex>.
  In <Drv1Func>, define new rule for <FILLJOT DydOp StrandInst>.
  In <Drv1Func>, define new rule for <FILLJOT DydOp Drv1Func>.
  In <Drv2Func>, define new rule for <StrandInst DydOp FILLJOT>.
  In <Drv2Func>, define new rule for <FILLJOT DydOp AxisFunc>.
  In <LeftOper>, define new rule for <MonOp FILLJOT>.
  In <LeftOper>, define new rule for <RightOper DydOp FILLJOT>.
  In <LeftOper>, define new rule for <FILLJOT DydOp LeftOper>.
  In <LeftOper>, define new rule for <FILLJOT DydOp FILLJOT>.
  In <LookaheadAdjacent>, define additional Boolean argument
    to indicate whether or not to look beyond a {jot}.
  In <LookaheadAdjacent>, handle FILLJOT as next token type.
  Simplify calls to <LookaheadDyadicOp> as it returns TRUE
    and FALSE only.
  In <LookaheadDyadicOp>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  In <pl_yylex> when handling <TKT_VARNAMED>, be sure to return
    something if we fall through.  This isn't a bug (as yet),
    just good coding practice.

PO_CMIDDOT.C:
PO_DIERESIS.C:
PO_DIJOT.C:
PO_DITILDE.C:
PO_DOT.C:
PO_JOT.C:
PO_SLASH.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Check for FILLJOT and signal a SYNTAX ERROR if present.

PO_JOTDOT.C:
  Minor text changes.
  When monadic JotDot is called, signal a VALENCE ERROR
    not a SYNTAX ERROR.
  Check for FILLJOT and signal a SYNTAX ERROR if present.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <TokenTypeFV>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.

STRAND.C:
  In <FreeStrand>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  In <MakeVarStrand_EM_YY>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  Define new routine <MakeFillJot_YY> to create a <PL_YYSTYPE>
    entry for  FILLJOT.
  In <CopyToken_EM>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <Untokenize>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.
  In <AppendNewToken_EM>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.

TOKENS.H:
  Define new token for FILLJOT.

YYFNS.C:
  In <IncrFcnMem>, treat FILLJOT the same as FCNIMMED.


Directory trunk\htdocs:

INDEX-BODY.AHTML:
  Note that []IDENTITY is implemented.
  Include additional Power Operator cases:  f{power}N and f{power}{jot}.
