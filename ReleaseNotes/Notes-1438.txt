* Prepare To Use Our Own Workspace Writer

Directory trunk:

DICTIONARY.C:
  In <hashlittleConv>, convert units from char to WCHAR.
  In <dictionary_del>, zap the items after freeing them so as to catch errors later on.
  In <dictionary_get>, pass additional argument needed in a later build.

DICTIONARY.H:
  Define <LPWCHAR> and <LPUBOOL> as we don't #include "types.h" anymore.

INIFILE.C:
  Use string safe functions as in MySprintf(W) instead of wsprintf(W), etc.
  Define new <ProfileXXX> functions for use in a later build.

INIPARSER.C:
  Omit "types.h" as that complicates other types.
  Define prototypes for later use.
  Define new <iniparser_XXX> functions for use in a later build.
  Use string safe functions as in MySprintf(W) instead of wsprintf(W), etc.
