Version 0.0.3.3 consists of the following Builds:


Build #901 -- Version 0.0.3.3
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When Matching Scalar Global Numeric And Simple Numeric Scalar

Directory trunk:

PF_EQUALUND.C:
  Fix Bug:  When matching a scalar global numeric and a simple numeric scalar
    or another global numeric scalar, note that we've already moved both of the
    left and right global memory ptrs to point to the data.


Build #900 -- Version 0.0.3.3
-----------------------------

* Optimize Some Number-Theoretic Functions

Directory trunk:

DISPLAY.C:
  In <FormatAplRatFC>, don't canonicalize unless trhe denominator is NE 1.

MPFNS.C:
  In <mpz_set_sa>/<mpq_set_sa>, handle set to zero specially so we don't
    overallocate the number.

PF_BAR.C:
PF_COLONBAR.C:
PF_STAR.C:
  Delete call to <mpz_canonicalize> as this functions can't create
    un-canonicalized numbers.

PF_PI.C:
  In <PrimFnDydPiRisRvR>/<PrimFnDydPiVisVvV>, catch raised exceptions from
    below so we can clear the local global numerics we create along the way.
  In <PrimFnPiNthPrime>, call common routine <NthPrime> that uses previous
    information to optimize its performance.
  In <PrimFnPiNumPrime>, call common routine <NumPrimes> that uses previous
    information to optimize its performance.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Clear the exception code for WS FULL.


Build #899 -- Version 0.0.3.3
-----------------------------

* Allow R In 6{pi}R To Be Fractional
* Allow 5{pi}0 In Origin-0
* Handle Quadratic Sieve Returning Factor Of One
* Fix Bug:  2{pi}R Fails
* Make 5{pi}R To Be Origin-Sensitive
* Fix Bug:  5{pi}R Returns Results Shifted

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  Allow R in 6{pi}R for fractional R.
  Allow 5{pi}0 in origin-0.
  Check for <tinyqs> returning 1 as the first factor.
  Fix Bug:  2{pi}R fails due to wrong comparison and wrong var.
  Make 5{pi}R (Nth prime) origin-sensitive.
  In <PrimFnPiNthPrime>, include missing power of 10 (10^17).
  Fix Bug:  5{pi}1 2 3 incorrectly returns 0 2 3.


Build #898 -- Version 0.0.3.3
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Reduction Of One-element Global Numeric Vector Returns Wrong Result

Directory trunk:

PO_SLASH.C:
  Fix Bug:  Reduction of a one-element global numeric vector returns the
    wrong result because a variable wasn't initialized.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.3.3.
